# in v2.0.0 retires (xfwm4, i3 → sway).  `dnf install mde` on a

# `~/Pictures`, etc. from the replicated `mesh-home` volume
# (see `docs/PROJECT_WORKLIST.md` GF-2.x / GF-4.x for the

# the aggregator publishes its overlay IP via QNM-Shared and
# children stream to it. Fail-soft: when the aggregator is
# unreachable each peer self-parents (7-day local dbengine
# retention). The birthright `apply_netdata_monitor` step
# writes /etc/netdata/netdata.conf with the locked baseline
# params (dbengine memory mode + 7d retention + cloud off +

# VV-1 + VV-1.5 (v4.1.0) — voice stack. Kamailio is the SIP

# socket-IPC to greeters); regreet is the Rust+GTK4 greeter
# UI; cage is the one-window wlroots compositor that hosts
# regreet so pre-auth has no escape keybindings. LightDM
# stays Required for now (rollback path); the
# `apply_display_manager()` birthright step (DM-5) is what
# flips the systemd default on first wizard run. All three

%description
Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE) is a Wayland-only Fedora desktop
environment built on sway as the compositor. v2.0.0 retires the XFCE
session host that v1.x ran on top of — sway / swaylock / swayidle /
swaybg replace xfce4-session + xfwm4 + xfdesktop; the Iced MDE
Workbench replaces the GTK3 xfce4-settings; mde-session orchestrates
first-boot config migration off the v1.x xfconf tree. One Workbench
window, a dashboard, nine task groups (Look & Feel, Devices, Network,
System, Apps, Maintain, Fleet, Help, Dashboard), and a first-run
wizard that brings a fresh machine to a known preset in under five
minutes. PatternFly v6 styling (Red Hat Display / Text / Mono).

XOrg/i3 session add-on for Mackes Desktop Environment.  Installs
the i3-backed mde-session binary (built --features x11), the
mde-xorg.desktop XSession entry, an i3 config tuned for MDE, and
a systemd user target that gates on DISPLAY instead of
WAYLAND_DISPLAY.  Install alongside the main `mde` package to get
both session choices in the display-manager greeter.

# INST-1 (v2.7, 2026-05-25) — addon RPM that adds every GUI
# binary + Wayland-stack runtime dep to a base `mde` install.
# Lighthouse VPS boxes and headless mesh peers `dnf install mde`
# without dragging in sway / wlroots / GTK / iced / KDC2 GUI
# plugins / Roboto fonts. A full desktop install runs
# `dnf install mde mde-desktop` (or pulls the

%changelog
* Fri May 22 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 2.0.3-1
- Operator-verification hotfix bundle (2026-05-22 bench install on
  a laptop + 4K-TV dual-monitor rig surfaced 7 defects, fixed at
  source). Full per-defect breakdown in CHANGELOG.md.
- Sway config: bindsym restart → reload (i3-only command was firing
  swaynag every login); removed 5 duplicate bindings overlapping
  mackes-defaults.conf; added arrow-key focus aliases; added
  `exec mde-panel` autostart line.
- mde-panel: fixed Wayland xdg-shell app_id propagation
  (shell.mackes.Panel) — Iced 0.13 doesn't inherit it from
  iced::Settings.id on Linux; needs window::Settings.platform_specific.
- mde-migrate-from-1x: now disables + removes obsolete v1.x systemd
  user units (qnm-daemon.service first), stopping a 290+/min
  restart loop on every fresh v2 boot.
- packaging: Requires: mako + Conflicts: dunst so Wayland-native
  notifications converge on install. Operator helper
  install-helpers/bench-bootstrap.sh ships for in-place upgrades.
- bin/mde-output-autoscale: width-based per-output scale picker
  applied at every session start (4K → 2.0, 2K → 1.5, ≤1080p →
  1.0) so 4K TVs are readable out of the box. Sacrosanct override
  rule: scale != 1.0 is treated as intentional and skipped.
- Right-click admin menu: every sudo call site replaced with
  pkexec sh -c so privileged actions work under Wayland sessions
  where terminator doesn't always inherit a controlling TTY.
- Desktop watermark: rebranded "Mackes XFCE Workstation" →
  "Mackes Desktop Environment". Added build-date stamp synced
  between legacy GTK + new Iced watermarks via
  /usr/share/mde/build-{hash,date}.

* Wed May 20 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 2.0.0-1
- v2.0.0 monolithic cut commit (CB-3.1 lock + CB-2.2 + CB-3.2 +
  CB-3.3 + CB-3.5 + H.1 + H.2 + H.4 + Phase 0.7 + 0.8 landed
  together so dnf upgrade lands on mde-2.0.0 in one transaction).
- Name: mackes-xfce-workstation → mde. Provides + Obsoletes carry
  both mackes-shell and mackes-xfce-workstation so existing dnf
  upgrade paths resolve cleanly.
- CB-3.2: every XFCE Requires dropped (xfconf, xfce4-settings,
  xfce4-session, xfce4-power-manager, terminator, i3, i3status,
  dmenu, wmctrl, xprop, xorg-x11-server-utils, xdotool); the
  Wayland stack lands hard-Requires (sway, swaylock, swayidle,
  swaybg, foot, bemenu, brightnessctl, pipewire, wireplumber,
  grim, slurp). New Recommends: cosmic-files, yazi, kanshi,
  wlogout, wofi.
- CB-3.3: Conflicts block per Q5 lock (xfce4-panel, xfdesktop,
  xfce4-session, xfce4-settings, xfwm4, xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin,
  xfce4-docklike-plugin, xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin,
  xfce4-power-manager-plugin, i3 — all `< 999` cap pattern).
- CB-3.5 / H.4: every XDG autostart override retired
  (mackes-panel.desktop, xfdesktop.desktop, mackes-enforce-session
  .desktop, mackes-suppress-xfce4-panel.desktop,
  kdeconnect-indicator.desktop). Wayland session orchestrator
  handles bring-up natively.
- C panel-plugin trio retired (mackes-clipboard, mackes-launcher,
  mackes-drawer). Their roles move to native mackes-panel applets
  in Phase E.1.x (Iced port). BuildRequires drops
  xfce4-panel-devel + libxfce4ui-devel.
- 21 Iced Workbench panels shipped in v1.1.x partial-progress
  cuts now compose the v2.0.0 Workbench surface (mde-workbench
  binary, /usr/bin/mde-workbench).
- 5 mded subcommands shipped: nodes list, ansible-history list,
  playbooks {list, run}, events list.

* Wed May 20 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 1.1.4-1
- Drop all 5 remaining XFCE Obsoletes (dnf5 implicit_ts_elements
  assertion fix, take 2). RPM now installs cleanly on Fedora 44.

* Sat May 16 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 0.2.0-1
- Identity: stripped "PRIVATE WORK / Sub Testing Release" markers from
  dashboard, wizard, and About dialog.
- Wizard rebuilt as a 3-act ceremony: spare welcome, 4-card preset picker
  with wallpaper thumbnails, narrated apply ("Becoming <preset>" →
  "You are now <preset>").
- Replaced single chupre preset with FOUR: hashbang (default, display
  '#!'), mackes, daylight, vanilla. Each ships its own polybar / plank /
  rofi profile + wallpaper.
- Design system: SF Pro typography stack, mackes-* CSS classes, and
  per-preset accent CSS swapped at startup based on state.active_preset.
- New Polybar Editor (replaces Q12 preset-picker lock): 21 vendored
  adi1090x families, pure-function generator, 3-zone DnD module editor,
  save-as-profile, live debounced apply.
- MaintenanceKit: 4 new panels — System Update (pkexec dnf wrapper),
  Drift (first-class per-key revert/adopt), Fonts (fc-list browser +
  preview + quick installs), Power (power-profiles-daemon), Resources
  (CPU/RAM/disk live cards).
- Recovery shell foundation: mackes/recover.py TTY snapshot picker,
  mackes-recovery.target systemd unit, GRUB submenu source, idempotent
  install-helpers/install-recovery.sh.
- Update mechanism plumbing: data/dnf/mackes-shell.repo pointing at
  matthewmackes.github.io/MAP2-RELEASES, add-mackes-repo.sh helper.
- ISO build scaffolding: packaging/iso/mackes-xfce.ks kickstart + `make
  iso` target.
- Headless apply CLI: `python3 -m mackes.cli_apply --preset NAME`.
- Test runner that works without pytest: tests/_run_without_pytest.py
  (`make test-nodeps`).
- Vendored adi1090x/polybar-themes (GPL-3.0) under
  data/shell-profiles/polybar/upstream/ — 8.7 MB, 21 families.

* Sat May 16 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 0.1.1-1
- MAP2 Sub Testing Release. PRIVATE WORK.
- Drop Workstation/Laptop/Audio Rig/Server Console presets; ship only chupre (Q1).
- Add Apps tab (Install / Remove / Installed) — curated install set with
  third-party repo auto-enablement (Microsoft Edge, VS Code) plus Cursor
  AppImage and Claude CLI via npm (C1–C3).
- Add Lean XFCE removal — xfce4-panel/appfinder/xfdesktop/xfce4-notifyd
  removed when their replacements (polybar/rofi/plank/dunst) are running.
  Reinstalled automatically on uninstall (X1–X5).
- Add Maintain → Uninstall + mackes --uninstall CLI + uninstall.sh artifact.
  Auto-snapshots to ~/Desktop/, wipes user files, resets xfconf, cleans v2.2
  leftovers (Q8–Q30, Q46–Q47).
- Add session-manager extension: managed-process supervisor with status
  dots on Dashboard + Start/Stop/Restart controls in System → Session
  (C6, C11). Also drives chupre dotfiles staging (alacritty + gtk-3.0 +
  gtk-4.0 from chupre/dotfiles tree/v2/.config).
- Fix Polybar autostart: install ~/.config/autostart/mackes-polybar.desktop,
  parse bar names from the active profile (no more hardcoded `polybar
  mackes`), and capture stderr to ~/.local/share/mackes-shell/logs/polybar.log
  (P1 lock).
- Wire MAP2 branding logo into About dialog, Wizard welcome screen and
  Dashboard header. Add 'PRIVATE WORK — Sub Testing Release' banner to
  the Dashboard.

* Fri May 15 2026 Matt Mackes <matthewmackes@gmail.com> - 0.1.0-1
- Initial Mackes Shell RPM.
- Replaces xfce4-settings menu entries via NoDisplay overrides (Q19).
- Ships the erikdubois/plankthemes catalog under data/plank-themes/.
- Single-binary entry: /usr/bin/mackes routes to wizard or workbench.
