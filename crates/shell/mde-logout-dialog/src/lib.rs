//! Phase D.2 — pure-logic core of the MDE logout / restart /
//! shutdown confirmation dialog.
//!
//! The Iced GUI lives in `bin/mde-logout-dialog`. This library
//! holds:
//!
//!   * [`Action`] — the three things the dialog can do.
//!   * [`Choice`] — the cancel/confirm result the GUI returns.
//!   * [`exit_code`] — the integer the binary exits with so the
//!     parent (`mde-session`) can map confirmation back to a
//!     system action.
//!   * [`title`] / [`primary_button_label`] — locked copy. Pulled
//!     from the design spec; locked so the wording doesn't drift
//!     and changes show up in a diff.
//!
//! Keeping the core dep-free means session.rs can `cargo test` it
//! in milliseconds without spinning up Iced + wgpu + the Wayland
//! event loop.
