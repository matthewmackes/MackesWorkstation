//! BUS-1.8 — `mde-bus` CLI surface.
//!
//! Centralises every operator-facing subcommand the binary
//! exposes. The `mde-bus` entry point is a thin shim over
//! [`run`] — keeps clap setup + tracing init + dispatch in one
//! testable place rather than scattered across `main.rs`.
//!
//! Verbs (one file each):
//!
//! - `publish` — write a message to a topic + forward to the
//!   local ntfy broker. Accepts the body as positional arg,
//!   `--body` flag, or piped stdin (three publish forms per the
//!   BUS-1.8 task body).
//! - `tail` — follow messages on a topic (or wildcard pattern)
//!   by polling the SQLite index since a cursor. Exits cleanly
//!   on Ctrl-C.
//! - `sub` — add / remove / list subscriptions in the per-peer
//!   `~/.local/share/mde/bus/subs.yaml`.
//! - `mute` — add / remove / list mute patterns in the same file.
//! - `history` — print the last N messages on a topic.
//! - `topic` — list every known topic (with priority +
//!   description) or match a wildcard pattern.
//! - `daemon` — run the long-lived bus daemon (broker + mDNS +
//!   subs watcher + hooks listener). Moved here from main.rs
//!   so tests can exercise its skip semantics without exec.
//! - `render` — render a Tera template against live mesh vars.
