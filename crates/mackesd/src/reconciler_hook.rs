//! Phase 2.8 — mesh reconciler hook for Send-To outcomes.
//!
//! When an operation finishes (success or failure), the
//! orchestrator's terminal-state transition feeds this module.
//! For Sync / Deploy operations we compare the per-peer expected
//! list against the per-peer landed list and raise a
//! [`DriftEvent`] for every peer where the two diverge.
//!
//! The drift events flow into the v12.0 reconciler so the fleet
//! state stays self-correcting (next reconcile pass closes the
//! gap or escalates to the operator).
//!
//! Pure-fn / pure-data module — no DBus / async / I/O. The actual
//! reconciler subscribes via a channel passed in by the
//! supervisor.
