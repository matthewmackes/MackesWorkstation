//! Phase 12.18 — HTTPS-tunneled fallback policy layer.
//!
//! Locked 2026-05-19 (Q10 + Q18 of the connectivity survey,
//! `docs/design/v12-connectivity-scope.md`):
//!
//!   * Activates after **3 consecutive failed direct-UDP +
//!     DERP-UDP probe pairs** (one "failure cycle" = one direct
//!     UDP probe failing AND its DERP-UDP counterpart failing in
//!     the same observation window). Two failure cycles = wait;
//!     three = activate.
//!   * Targets TCP/443 + a realistic TLS handshake + SNI + a
//!     Let's Encrypt cert chain. Goal: indistinguishable from
//!     real HTTPS to deep-packet-inspection middleboxes.
//!   * Once activated, stays activated until a fresh **direct-UDP
//!     OR DERP-UDP probe succeeds**, at which point we revert to
//!     the upstream path.
//!
//! This module ships the **policy layer** — the failure-window
//! detector + the activation state machine + the pure-fn
//! transition rules. The actual TLS handshake + tunnel transport
//! is a separate wire-protocol module that consumes
//! `HttpsFallback::is_active()`; gated behind future work that
//! pulls in `rustls` + the realistic SNI / cert chain bits.
//!
//! Pure-fn / pure-data — testable in microseconds.
