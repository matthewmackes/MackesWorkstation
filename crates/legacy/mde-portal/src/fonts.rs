//! Portal-3 — font + icon theme layer.
//!
//! ## Font stack
//!
//! | Role | Family | System package |
//! |------|--------|---------------|
//! | Primary | `Intel One Mono` | `intel-one-mono-fonts` |
//! | Icon fallback | `Symbols Nerd Font Mono` | `symbols-nerd-font-mono-fonts` |
//!
//! The RPM spec ships `Requires: intel-one-mono-fonts` so that fontconfig
//! resolves `Font::with_name(INTEL_ONE_MONO)` at runtime.  If the font is
//! absent (dev machine without the package) Iced degrades to its built-in
//! font gracefully.
//!
//! ## Material Symbols icon set
//!
//! `mde_theme::icons` is the canonical Material Symbols icon enum.
//! Portal surfaces import `mde_theme::icons::{Icon, IconSize}` and
//! call [`icon_glyph`] to get the Unicode fallback for a given
//! semantic icon; Portal-4 onward switches the call sites to SVG
//! bytes via UX-8.a.
//!
//! ## Nerd Glyph fallback
//!
//! `NERD_SYMBOLS_FONT` names the Symbols Nerd Font Mono family, which
//! provides icon codepoints (U+E000..U+F8FF + extensions) for any
//! Material Symbols icon that hasn't yet received real SVG bytes.
//! Iced's font cascade falls through to this family when the primary
//! font lacks a glyph.
