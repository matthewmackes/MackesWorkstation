"""End-to-end xdotool smoke (Phase 9.3).

Drives the running ``mackes-panel`` through xdotool to assert the
worklist's named E2E flow:

  1. Launch the panel (already running under Xvfb in CI).
  2. Locate the Mackes / apple-menu button on the bottom taskbar.
  3. Click it to open the start menu.
  4. Navigate to the Applications submenu.
  5. Launch a known app (xterm — kept as the canary because Firefox
     isn't available on every CI runner).
  6. Verify the running-indicator dot appears on the dock.

The test cooperates with the same Xvfb-on-:99 invariant as
``test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py``: skipped when ``DISPLAY != ":99"`` so
nobody runs xdotool against their actual desktop session by mistake.
Each substep records progress to a captured log so a failure mid-flow
points at the specific step that broke.
