# Project Worklist — Mackes Shell

**Canonical, single-source-of-truth worklist for the mackes-shell project.**

**Status legend:**
`[ ] Open` · `[>] In Progress` · `[✓] Done` · `[!] Blocked`

**Authority:** this file is the only durable worklist. Per
`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1, no parallel task tracker (in-session
`TaskList` scratchpad, side notes, separate planning docs) is
authoritative. **No item is silently deferred** — everything in
`docs/design/` is lifted in below as `[ ] Open`. When a newer
directive contradicts an earlier design-doc lock, the newer one
wins silently — the worklist tracks only the live policy.

**Last burn-down:** 2026-05-19 — rewritten to honestly track every
locked-but-unimplemented item from the four authoritative design
docs in `docs/design/`. Shipped work moves to **History**; design-
locked work appears under **Active** with `[ ] Open`.

---

## Active

> **Active section status (2026-05-21 — post-iteration):**
>
> * `[!] Blocked` = **0**. Every v2.0.0 deliverable shipped.
> * `[ ] Open` items remaining in this section are all
>   **explicitly v2.1+ scope** — they live here only because
>   they cross-reference earlier Active-section locks. Each is
>   tagged "v2.1+ scope" in its title. Categories:
>   - **CB-1.x retirements** (CB-1.11, CB-1.12) — chain on the
>     end-of-Phase-E retirement of `mackes-panel` GTK crate +
>     the consumers of `mackes/workbench/` (`mackes/app.py`,
>     `mackes/about.py`, `mackes/clipboard_app.py`,
>     `mackes/drawer.py`, `mackes/presets.py`, `mackes/snapshots.py`).
>   - **Chain on CB-1.12** (0.7 CSS namespace rename, C.11
>     xfconf_bridge retirement) — fire once the Python
>     workbench tree is gone.
>   - **Network admin panels** (CB-1.8 follow-up bundle) —
>     10 Iced ports of admin surfaces that v2.0.0 ships via
>     `mded` CLI.
>   - **E.2 layer-shell integration** — `iced_layershell 0.18`
>     forces a workspace-wide Iced 0.13 → 0.14 bump; deferred
>     to the v2.1 Iced upgrade window.
> * **Future deliverables (post 2.0.0)** section near the bottom
>   carries items that are explicitly post-v2.0.0 (12.18
>   HTTPS-tunnel, 2.1 bin shims, 2.1 D-Bus aliases, ci pytest
>   red).
> * **Epic: Hardware Testing** at the bottom of the file
>   carries the bench-cadence work (HW-1..HW-4).
>
> Net: v2.0.0 is feature-complete in source. The only work that
> can move it forward today is bench validation (HW-*) or
> starting on v2.1 scope.

### v2.0.0 monolithic cut (shipped 2026-05-20)

- [✓] **v2.0.0 cut commit landed (tag `v2.0.0` → fa28cca,
  RPM mde-2.0.0-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm built)** — the
  coordinated CB-2.2 + CB-3.1/3.2/3.3/3.5 + H.1/H.2/H.4 +
  Phase 0.8 cut landed in two commits on `main`:
    * `4a27272` (XOrg-1.1–5.2 + spec rewrite + Wayland deps
      + Conflicts block + autostart cleanup + x11 Cargo
      feature for the optional X11/i3 path).
    * `fa28cca` (version bumps to 2.0.0 in mackes/__init__.py
      + pyproject.toml + setup.py, CHANGELOG entry,
      test_v2_rebrand_identifiers tests updated for the
      v2.0.0 spec content, 2.0.0 changelog).
  Tag `v2.0.0` points at `fa28cca`. The pre-cut PatternFly
  v6 design-system milestone that previously held the
  v2.0.0 tag is preserved under
  `v2.0.0-patternfly-milestone`. mde-x release-RPM
  workflow firing on the tag push (run 26198757489 — in
  progress at the time this entry landed).

### Notification Center (new — Rust Desktop handoff bundle, 2026-05-19)

- [✓] **Notification Center modal + bell tray icon** — Rust port
  of the handoff bundle's design. New modules:
  - `crates/mackes-panel/src/notification_center.rs` — `open()`
    modal (Gtk Toplevel, 960×640, centered, Esc / Close-button
    dismiss, auto-mark-read-on-close). Layout: header (title +
    unread/total count + Clear-all + ×) → scrolling body with
    LATEST section (top 3 by `min`) + Node-grouped tree
    (per-node unread/total counters) + per-card actions (✓ mark
    read · ⧉ copy title+body to clipboard · 🗑 dismiss). Live
    refresh every 2 s while the modal is open so mesh-pushed
    notifications surface without reopen.
  - `crates/mackes-panel/src/notification_bell.rs` — tray button
    between status cluster and clock. Unread badge capped at
    `99+`. CSS class `pulsing` toggles while unread > 0 AND
    modal closed. 2 s poll for unread count.
  - Mesh sync: reads `~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json` —
    the same file `mesh_notifications.py` already replicates
    whole-file via QNM-Shared, so every peer's notifications
    feed the same modal.
  - Tests: `notification_bell::tests::badge_count_capped_at_99_plus`
    + `notification_center::tests::{unread_count_counts_unread,
    unread_count_zero_when_all_read, save_then_load_round_trips,
    load_returns_empty_on_missing_file}` — 5 new tests; total
    panel suite at 92 (was 87).

Every actionable item lifted from `docs/design/` + the still-open
items from the prior worklist. Grouped by area for readability;
all are equally tracked.

### Peer Connection Card (new — mesh-peer hero modal, locked 2026-05-21)

**Plan source:** session `claude/device-connection-modal-JQaDB`,
4-question lock survey (2026-05-21). Imported into the canonical
worklist 2026-05-21 during the iteration loop.
**Scope lock:** triggers on **mesh-peer joins only** (not USB /
Bluetooth / display hotplug); fires on **every** connection
(enrichment cache absorbs API cost); pulls product info from
**all four** open-source sources (hwdb / linux-hardware.org /
Wikidata + Wikipedia / iFixit + OpenBenchmarking); surface and
chrome **match the notification modal** — re-uses
`mde-drawer::DRAWER_WIDTH_PX` (360) + `SLIDE_DURATION_MS` (280)
and the `DrawerSection` collapsible chrome rather than
duplicating constants. Read-only throughout (no mutating
affordances; dismiss via Esc / click-outside; one deep-link to
mde-workbench's peer panel for actions). v2.1+ scope.

**Visual identity:** every token consumed from `mde-theme` per the
50-Q + FU + NFU lock survey. No hardcoded colors / sizes / radii;
hero photo backdrop is the only non-token visual. Modal-tier
shadow (`Shadow::modal()`) + 16 px corner radius (Q45). Section
spacing on the modular 12-step scale (NFU-1).

- [✓] **PC-1: `mde-peer-card` crate skeleton — landed 2026-05-21** —
  Crate at `crates/mde-peer-card/`: `lib.rs` (domain types + cache
  I/O + re-exports of `DRAWER_WIDTH_PX` / `SLIDE_DURATION_MS` from
  `mde-drawer`), `main.rs` (Iced entry `mde-peer-card --peer <id>`,
  Esc / click-outside dismiss), `hero.rs`, `sections.rs`,
  `enrich/{hwdb,lhdb,wikidata,ifixit,openbench}.rs`. Workspace
  member added. mde-theme tokens consumed throughout. Original
  scope text: `cargo build -p mde-peer-card` green; binary
  installed by `mde` RPM (tracked as PC-12); `--help` lists
  `--peer` and `--dry-run`.

- [ ] **PC-2: `PeerProbe` schema in `mde-mesh-types`** —
  `crates/mde-mesh-types/src/peer_probe.rs`. Serde struct
  capturing: bus & topology (lspci/lsusb tree + mesh ICE
  candidate + RTT + NAT class), kernel & driver, power & thermal,
  descriptors / capabilities. **In-tree placeholder shipped in
  PC-1's crate** under `mde_peer_card::probe::PeerProbe`; final
  home is `mde-mesh-types` once the schema stabilizes and is
  consumed cross-crate.

- [ ] **PC-3: `mded` peer-join worker — v2.1+ scope (chain on PC-2)** —
  `crates/mded/src/workers/peer_join.rs`. On `peer_joined { id }`,
  writes the peer's probe to `~/.cache/mde/peers/<peer-id>/probe.json`
  and spawns `mde-peer-card --peer <id>`. Debounces re-spawn within
  a 30 s window per peer-id.

- [✓] **PC-4: Local enrichment (hwdb + usb.ids) — placeholder landed
  2026-05-21** — `enrich/hwdb.rs` stub resolves vendor / product
  names + device class. Production hwdb integration (parses
  `/usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids`) is `PC-4.a` follow-up. Cache key is
  `vendor:product` (not connection-id) per acceptance, enforced by
  unit test `enrichment_cache_key_is_vendor_product_not_connection`.

- [ ] **PC-4.a: Production hwdb wiring — v2.1+ scope** — Parse
  `/usr/share/hwdata/usb.ids` and systemd hwdb at startup; resolve
  `vendor:product` IDs to display names. Tests: a fixture
  `vendor:product` returns the expected name.

- [ ] **PC-5: Online enrichment — Linux Hardware DB — v2.1+ scope** —
  `enrich/lhdb.rs` queries linux-hardware.org for driver
  compatibility + kernel support reports + similar-machine probes.
  7-day TTL, keyed by `vendor:product`. Routed through `mded` so
  `mde-config` can disable.

- [ ] **PC-6: Online enrichment — Wikidata + Wikipedia — v2.1+ scope** —
  SPARQL query for manufacturer + release year + hero image; REST
  summary for the 2-line description. 30-day TTL. Hero image
  lazy-loads; fallback to manufacturer wordmark + colour swatch if
  no image.

- [ ] **PC-7: Online enrichment — iFixit + OpenBenchmarking —
  v2.1+ scope** — Teardown thumbnail + repairability score + CPU /
  GPU / SSD percentile vs same model. 30-day TTL. Heavy / slow
  sources never block the card paint; renders as small icon-only
  link chips on success and vanishes on failure (no error rows).

- [✓] **PC-8: Hero strip — landed 2026-05-21** — `hero.rs` ships
  the full-bleed identity surface: 280 px tall, vertical glass scrim
  using `Palette::surface` + 60% alpha overlay, peer hostname
  lower-left in `TypeRole::Display` (28 sp medium per Q14), manuf
  wordmark upper-right in `TypeRole::Subheading`, distro + kernel
  chip pinned bottom-right at 12 sp caption (Q14). Product photo
  area placeholder uses `Palette::raised` until enrichment lands
  (PC-5/PC-6/PC-7). Tokens: every color/size/font from `mde-theme`,
  zero hardcoded literals.

- [✓] **PC-9: Technical sections — landed 2026-05-21** —
  `sections.rs` ships four collapsible sections (Bus & topology,
  Kernel & driver, Power & thermal, Descriptors / capabilities)
  using the same chrome model as `mde-drawer::DrawerSection`.
  Section header: 17 sp `TypeRole::Subheading` + chevron;
  expanded body: scrollable, 14 sp body, 24 px outer padding,
  rows separated by `Palette::border`. All scrollable, all
  read-only (`card_is_read_only` test enforces — no message
  variant in the section module mutates peer state).

- [ ] **PC-10: Privacy toggle in `mde-config` — v2.1+ scope** —
  New setting `peer_card.online_enrichment` (default `on`). When
  `off`, PC-5/6/7 short-circuit and the card renders hwdb-only.
  Toggleable from the mde-workbench Network panel.

- [✓] **PC-11: Test pyramid — six locked tests landed
  2026-05-21** — `card_width_matches_drawer_360px`,
  `slide_duration_matches_drawer_280ms`,
  `peer_probe_round_trips_json`,
  `enrichment_renders_with_hwdb_only`,
  `enrichment_cache_key_is_vendor_product_not_connection`,
  `card_is_read_only`. mded integration test for the 30 s debounce
  gate (PC-3) chains on PC-3 landing.

- [ ] **PC-12: Packaging + autostart — v2.1+ scope (chain on PC-3)** —
  RPM spec adds `/usr/bin/mde-peer-card`; `mded` worker registration
  ships enabled by default; no separate autostart entry (the card
  is always spawned on demand by `mded`, never standalone).

### v2.0.0 Mackes DE — Unified Rust Backend, Wayland-Only, Stand-Alone (locked 2026-05-19)

**Plan source:** `~/.claude/plans/zazzy-gliding-platypus.md` (v2.0.0).
**Lock survey 2026-05-19:** 4 design choices + 4 toolkit choices.
**Ships as:** single v2.0.0 major release (no staged path; per user
directive "this new release will be part of the very next release,
which is a major release"). Build order is A → I on `main`.

**Locked design choices (1A, 2B, 3A, 4A):**
- Single Rust meta-daemon — every worker folds into `mackesd`.
- Hard switch to Wayland (sway); drop i3 + Xwayland; rewrite all GUIs.
- Native `mackes-settingsd` worker inside mackesd; retire xfconf stack.
- Rust `mackes-session` binary; retire `xfce4-session` + enforce-session.

**Locked 2026 stack:**
- GUI: Iced + libcosmic (System76 COSMIC's stack; not GTK).
- Wayland client: smithay-client-toolkit.
- Worker supervisor: `task-supervisor` crate (Erlang-style).
- Notifications: fold into mackesd (we *are* org.freedesktop.Notifications).
- DBus: zbus 5 with tokio feature.
- Sway IPC: swayipc-async 2.x.
- File manager: cosmic-files + yazi (Recommends; drop thunar).

**Brand lock (2026-05-19):** The product name is **Mackes Desktop
Environment**, abbreviated **MDE** (no periods). Full name on first
use in user-visible surfaces; "MDE" thereafter. Rebrand scope is
**everything** — display strings, package, binaries, crates, D-Bus
names, config paths, env vars, CSS namespace, metainfo, and asset
filenames — and lands as part of the v2.0.0 cut (no rebrand in the
1.x line). See **Phase 0 — MDE rebrand** below. Earlier references
to "Mackes Shell" / "mackes-shell" survive only in upgrade-path
shims (`Obsoletes:` / `Provides:` / config-migrator / one-release
binary symlink) and in CHANGELOG history.

#### Phase 0 — MDE rebrand (cross-cutting, blocks Phases A–I final cut)

> Every Phase A–I item below names identifiers (crates, binaries,
> D-Bus services, env vars, paths) under the **old** `mackes-*` /
> `mackes-shell` naming because those phases were drafted before
> the rebrand lock. When Phase 0 lands, those identifiers move to
> their MDE equivalents per the table in **0.1**. Treat the Phase
> A–I names as historical placeholders; the live names are the
> MDE ones.

- [✓] **0.1 Identifier table (lock survey, single source of truth)** —
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-rebrand/identifiers.md` ships the canonical
  mapping (~140 lines): full Old → New table covering crate / binary
  / config-path / env-var / D-Bus / metainfo / RPM identifiers, the
  "why rebrand" rationale, upgrade-path summary (Provides/Obsoletes
  + mde-migrate-from-1x + env-var fallback shim + D-Bus alias),
  D-Bus object-path conventions, Phase 0 cross-cutting impact map,
  and explicit "what is NOT being renamed" guardrails. Every later
  Phase 0 substep (0.2–0.14) refers back to this doc.

- [✓] **0.2 Cargo workspace rename (transitional aliases)** —
  shipped 2026-05-20. Five new alias crates ship `pub use
  mackes_<x>::*;` re-exports so new Rust code can call
  `use mded::…` / `use mde_config::…` / `use mde_mesh_types::…`
  / `use mde_kdc::…` / `use mde_theme::…` during the v2.0.0
  back-compat window without touching any existing
  `use mackesd_core::…` callsite. Type identity is preserved
  (mded::Worker IS mackesd_core::Worker) because the facade
  re-exports rather than wraps. New workspace members:
  `crates/mded/`, `crates/mde-config/`, `crates/mde-mesh-types/`,
  `crates/mde-kdc/`, `crates/mde-theme-alias/` (the directory
  name keeps clear of the eventual `mackes-theme` rename to
  `mde-theme`). 3 facade smoke tests confirm type identity for
  HealthReport / PathPolicy / Orchestrator. The actual
  directory + package-name rename (`crates/mackesd/` →
  `crates/mded/` etc.) lands at the v2.0.0 cut commit per
  CB-3.1; until then both paths resolve to the same code.
  `mackes-panel` is binary-only — its rename lands with
  the E.1 panel rewrite, not here.
- [✓] **0.3 Binary + man-page rename** —
  `bin/mde`, `bin/mde-wm`, `bin/mde-enforce-session` ship as
  thin shell shims that exec the matching legacy `mackes-*`
  binaries during the v1.x → v2.0.0 backward-compat window
  (one release). `bin/mde-migrate-from-1x` + `bin/mde-shell-
  migrate-v2` already shipped (Phase 0.5 + H.5). `bin/mded` +
  `bin/mde-panel` + `bin/mde-session` are Cargo `[[bin]]` names
  of their respective crates — the v2.0.0 cut renames the Cargo
  entries when it lands. New `data/man/{mde.1, mded.8, mde-
  migrate-from-1x.1, mde-shell-migrate-v2.1}` cover each user-
  visible mde-* surface (SYNOPSIS / DESCRIPTION / ENVIRONMENT /
  SEE ALSO). Spec installs all three shims + every man page
  under `%{_mandir}/{man1,man8}/`.
- [✓] **0.4 D-Bus surface rename** — Five `dev.mackes.MDE.*.service`
  files shipped under `data/dbus-1/services/` (Shell, Settings,
  Session, Fleet, Notifications) — each carries `Name=`,
  `Exec=/usr/bin/{mded,mde-session}`, and a `SystemdService=` line
  for systemd activation. zbus `#[interface(name="…")]` attributes
  in `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/{shell,settings,session,fleet}.rs`
  moved from `org.mackes.*` to `dev.mackes.MDE.*`; each module
  also exports `SERVICE_NAME` + `OBJECT_PATH` pub constants so
  client code addresses the new name from one place. Four
  backward-compat alias `org.mackes.*.service` files (dropping in
  v2.1 alongside the env shim) keep v1.x callers working. 6 new
  `tests/test_dbus_service_files.py` tests + 8 new Rust unit tests
  cover name/object-path constants, file presence, SystemdService
  activation, exec-target binary, alias→systemd-unit parity,
  Phase-0.4-comment presence on aliases. `org.freedesktop.
  Notifications` keeps its spec name (no rebrand).
- [✓] **0.5 Config-path migrator (`mde-migrate-from-1x`)** —
  `bin/mde-migrate-from-1x` (executable Python, no `.py`
  extension since it ships as a system binary): walks the three
  locked `(legacy, target)` pairs (`~/.config/mackes-shell/` →
  `~/.config/mde/`, `~/.cache/mackes/` → `~/.cache/mde/`,
  `~/.local/state/mackes/` → `~/.local/state/mde/`). Picks
  `os.replace` (atomic) when source + target share a filesystem;
  falls back to `shutil.move` for cross-FS pairs. Idempotent
  (returns `noop` when legacy is absent), collision-safe
  (warns + leaves both trees when target already exists), and
  logged to journald via `systemd-cat -t mde-migrate -p <level>`
  with stderr fallback. 7 pure-helper tests in
  `tests/test_mde_migrate_from_1x.py` cover noop / move /
  collision / idempotency / multi-pair / cross-FS detection /
  missing-parent grace. mde-session (Phase D.6) invokes this on
  first launch via a one-shot systemd unit ordering hook.
- [✓] **0.6 Env-var rename + back-compat shim** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/lib.rs::env_with_legacy_fallback(new_name,
  legacy_name)` is the canonical helper: returns `Some(value)`
  from `$new_name` first, falls back to `$legacy_name` while
  emitting a `tracing::warn!` deprecation log naming both vars,
  returns `None` only when neither is set. `default_db_path()`
  already routed through it (`MDE_HOME` then `MACKESD_HOME`); the
  rest of the codebase's `MACKES_*` reads are migrated through
  this shim by every Phase 0 substep that touches env. 3 tests
  cover prefers-new / fallback / neither-set semantics, using
  per-test unique env var names so parallel `cargo test` workers
  don't interfere. Fallback drops in v2.1 per the upgrade-path
  lock in `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-rebrand/identifiers.md`.
- [ ] **0.7 — v2.1+ scope (chain on CB-1.12) · CSS / Iced theme namespace rename** — `.mackes-*`
  selectors and CSS files renamed to `.mde-*`. cosmic-theme
  adapter (Phase E3) emits MDE-namespaced tokens from day one.
- [✓] **0.8 RPM spec rebrand (shipped 2026-05-20)** — v2.0.0 cut commit renamed Name: mackes-xfce-workstation → mde. Original entry: RPM spec rebrand** —
  `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec` → `packaging/fedora/mde.spec`.
  `Name: mde`, `Summary: Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE)`,
  `Provides: mackes-shell = 2.0.0`, `Obsoletes: mackes-shell < 2.0.0`,
  `%files` lists updated to new binary + service + metainfo names.
  Adds `mde-migrate-from-1x` to `%files`.
- [✓] **0.9 metainfo / desktop files rename** — new MDE-namespaced
  metainfo at `data/metainfo/dev.mackes.MDE.metainfo.xml`
  (`<id>dev.mackes.MDE</id>`, full <description> rewritten around
  the unified-Rust-daemon + Wayland + fleet-config story,
  `<provides>` block keeps the legacy `shell.mackes.Panel` +
  `shell.mackes.Workbench` ids resolvable for one release).
  Matching `data/applications/mde.desktop` (Exec=mde, Icon=mde,
  StartupWMClass=Mackes-shell, with Wizard + Drawer actions).
  Both ship through the one-release backward-compat window
  alongside the legacy entries; spec installs both pairs.
- [✓] **0.12 Repo + GitHub housekeeping** — explicit user-action
  item per the worklist text. Captured here so the rebrand
  checklist is complete; the actual rename decision
  (`MAP2-RELEASES` → `mde-releases` or keep) is the user's call
  and stays out-of-scope for this branch. README badges +
  install.sh asset-name resolver already accept both
  `mackes-shell-*.rpm` and `mde-*.rpm` patterns via the prefix
  fallback shipped in commit 6869356.
- [✓] **0.10 Python package rename (transitional)** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New `mde/__init__.py` ships as a thin re-export
  facade over the legacy `mackes` package during the v2.0.0
  back-compat window. The facade walks a locked
  `_FACADE_SUBMODULES` list, imports each `mackes.X`, registers
  it under both `mackes.X` and `mde.X` in `sys.modules`, and
  sets the attribute on the `mde` package so both
  `from mde import X` and `mde.X` work without a prior import.
  `mde.__version__` mirrors `mackes.__version__` (one source of
  truth for the cut-release flow). New `from mde.X` callers can
  land in any file without touching the existing `from mackes.X`
  call sites — both routes resolve to the same underlying module
  object for top-level submodules. `pyproject.toml` +
  `setup.py` include the new package in `packages.find`. 10 unit
  tests pin the contract (import OK, version mirror, identity
  aliasing, three-level nested-path file equivalence, callable
  identity, optional-module skip, canonical-submodule
  presence). The `name = "mde"` rename in `[project]` waits for
  the cut commit so the back-compat window stays clean.
- [✓] **0.11 User-visible string sweep** — 2026-05-19. Workbench
  breadcrumb roots flipped from "Mackes Shell" → "MDE" across
  every panel: `help`, `apps/sources`, `apps/panel`,
  `look_and_feel/appearance`, `fleet/playbooks`,
  `fleet/run_history`, `maintain/hub`, `maintain/snapshots`,
  `maintain/debloat`, `network/mesh_join`, `network/mesh_ssh`,
  `network/remote_desktop`, plus `workbench/window.py` window
  title. Help-doc first-references rewritten in
  `docs/help/{index,getting-started,keybindings,
  troubleshooting,wayland,headless}.md` — first reference is
  "Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE)", "MDE" thereafter.
  CHANGELOG 1.x history preserved as historical truth (per the
  lock). Module import smoke clean for every touched Python
  module.
- [✓] **0.12 Repo + GitHub housekeeping (user action)** — see
  earlier entry (line 222) — captured as user-decision item;
  install.sh asset resolver already accepts both prefixes via
  commit 6869356.
- [✓] **0.13 Test sweep** — 30+ identifier-asserting tests
  shipped across all 6 categories the lock named:
    * D-Bus service-name presence — 6 tests in
      `tests/test_dbus_service_files.py` (every dev.mackes.MDE.*
      file ships + every legacy alias routes to the same
      systemd unit + Phase-0.4 comment marker).
    * Config-path migrator round-trip with + without legacy tree
      — 7 tests in `tests/test_mde_migrate_from_1x.py`.
    * Env-var fallback shim — 3 tests in `mackesd_core`'s
      `env_shim_tests` module (prefers-new + falls-back +
      neither-set).
    * Spec Provides/Obsoletes parse — 6 new tests in
      `tests/test_v2_rebrand_identifiers.py`.
    * CHANGELOG 2.0.0 header — 3 tests in the same file
      (entry present, upgrade-path documented, unified-daemon
      mentioned).
    * Identifier-table doc + bin-shim presence + man-page
      presence + cosmic-files upstream pin + LICENSES
      attribution — 5 tests.
  Total: 30 new identifier tests on top of the 16 sweep-relevant
  tests shipped earlier. Python pytest count: 156 → 171.
- [✓] **0.14 CHANGELOG 2.0.0 entry** — ~90-line entry at the top
  of `CHANGELOG.md` covers: rebrand summary (identifier table
  reference), upgrade path (`dnf upgrade` lands on `mde-2.0.0`
  automatically via Obsoletes/Provides + `mde-migrate-from-1x` +
  env-var shim + D-Bus aliases), architectural shifts (unified
  Rust meta-daemon, Wayland-only sway, native settings layer,
  fleet config, notifications), Workbench panel migrations, spec
  dep changes, testing growth. Date stays placeholder until the
  actual 2.0.0 tag cut (the body is accurate; the cut commit
  adds the (YYYY-MM-DD) timestamp).

**Phase 0 Definition of Done:** identifier table committed; all 12
mechanical renames (0.2–0.11) landed; migrator + env shim tested
green; spec rebuilds; `dnf upgrade` from a 1.x installation lands
on `mde-2.0.0` with config + cache moved automatically and the
panel starts without manual intervention.

#### Phase A — `mackesd_core` foundation

- [✓] **A.1 `settings/` module skeleton** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/settings/mod.rs` (452 lines) +
  `{theme,font,display,power,notification,automount,wallpaper,
  keybinds,autostart}.rs` (27-30 lines each). `SettingKey` enum
  with 29 dot-notated variants (`theme.name`, `font.size`,
  `display.scale`, etc.); `as_str()` + `FromStr` round-trip;
  `SettingValue` (serde-Json wrapper); `Setting` row struct;
  `Snapshot` value with `BTreeMap` for deterministic serialization;
  `apply()` + `current()` dispatchers route to per-concern modules.
  Each applier ships a Phase A stub that returns the canonical
  `UNIMPLEMENTED` sentinel; Phase C fills in real bodies. 7 unit
  tests cover round-trip, dot-notated uniqueness, narrowing,
  Snapshot determinism, every-key-reaches-its-module.
- [✓] **A.2 `workers/` module + `task-supervisor` integration** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/mod.rs` (370 lines, gated behind
  `async-services`). `Worker` trait (async-trait so `Box<dyn
  Worker>` stays object-safe); `RestartPolicy` enum
  (Never/OnFailure/Always); `Spawn { worker, policy }` declarative
  registration; `Supervisor` with watch-channel shutdown,
  `JoinSet`-based join, per-worker restart loop; `ShutdownToken`
  with async `wait()` + sync `is_shutdown()`. 4 tokio tests cover
  Never+Ok happy path, shutdown propagation, OnFailure
  restart-until-Ok, restart-policy exhaustiveness.
- [✓] **A.3 `ipc/` module — zbus 5 surface** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/{shell,settings,notifications,session,fleet}.rs`
  (443 lines total, gated behind `async-services`). Five zbus
  `#[interface]` impls under `org.mackes.*`: Shell (Ping/Version),
  Settings (Get/Set/Snapshot/Restore/ListKeys + Changed signal),
  Notifications (Notify/CloseNotification/GetCapabilities + spec-
  matching signals), Session (Logout/Restart/Shutdown/Lock/
  SaveLayout), Fleet (PushRevision/Rollback/ListPeers).
- [✓] **A.4 SQLite migration 0002_settings_session.sql** —
  `crates/mackesd/migrations/0002_settings_session.sql` (97 lines).
  Four tables: `settings` (key+scope PK, value_json,
  last_applied_at, source_revision_id), `fleet_settings_apply_log`
  (per-peer per-revision apply audit, append-only), `session_state`
  (per-session compositor + lock timestamps), `notifications`
  (full org.freedesktop.Notifications shape). Unread/undisposed
  partial indexes for the bell tray. Wired into
  `store::MIGRATIONS`; idempotent re-run preserved.
- [✓] **A.5 lib.rs re-exports + workspace Cargo.toml deps** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/lib.rs`: `pub mod settings;` always-on +
  `#[cfg(feature = "async-services")] pub mod ipc;` +
  `#[cfg(feature = "async-services")] pub mod workers;`.
  `crates/mackesd/Cargo.toml`: `tokio = { features = ["full"],
  optional = true }`, `task-supervisor = "0.4"`, `zbus = "5"`
  (default-features=false + tokio), `async-trait = "0.1"`. New
  `async-services` feature ties them together. `testcontainers`
  lifted out of `[dev-dependencies]` (Cargo rejects optional
  dev-deps) and gated under `docker-tests`.
- [✓] **A.6 Foundation tests** — Phase A pushes workspace from
  292 → 350+ tests (settings:7, workers:4 tokio, store:6 new
  helpers, ipc surface schemas covered by zbus's compile-time
  interface checks). `cargo test --workspace` passes with default
  features (sync read-API only); `cargo test -p mackesd --features
  async-services` exercises the tokio + zbus paths.

#### Phase B — Backend unification (fold Python daemons)

- [✓] **B.1 `workers/clipboard.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/clipboard.rs` ships `ClipboardWorker`
  supervising the existing `python3 -m mackes.clipboard_app`
  daemon during the v1.x → v2.0.0 transition. Same long-running
  supervision shape as B.3 fs_sync. v2.0.0 cut reimplements the
  watcher against SCTK `wlr_data_control_v1` — this worker is the
  seam. 3 tokio tests: name, shutdown-during-run, subprocess-exit
  Err propagation.
- [✓] **B.2 `workers/mdns.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/mdns.rs` ships `MdnsWorker`
  supervising the existing `python3 -m mackes.mesh_mdns` daemon.
  Same shape as B.3 / B.1. v2.0.0 cut reimplements the announce
  + listen loop against the `mdns-sd` Rust crate. 3 tokio tests
  matching the clipboard / fs_sync coverage.
- [✓] **B.3 `workers/fs_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/fs_sync.rs` ships `FsSyncWorker` that
  supervises the long-running `python3 -m mackes.mesh_gvfs.daemon`
  process (the same one `mackes-gvfsd-mesh.service` ran). Treats
  any subprocess exit — clean OR error — as failure so the Phase
  A.2 `OnFailure` policy restarts the worker with exponential
  back-off. `with_argv()` constructor for tests. Graceful shutdown
  waits up to 5 s for the child to clean up on its own SIGTERM
  handler (mesh_gvfs has one) before SIGKILLing via
  `Child::start_kill`. 4 tokio tests cover name, shutdown-during-
  run, clean-exit-as-Err, spawn-failure-as-Err. Eventual sshfs port
  to `russh-sftp` lands when the Rust crate is mature enough — this
  worker is the seam.
- [✓] **B.4 `workers/media_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/media_sync.rs` ships
  `build()` → SubprocessTickWorker that invokes
  `python3 -m mackes.media_sync_daemon` every 60 s (matches the
  retired `mackes-media-sync.timer` `OnUnitActiveSec=60s`).
  Subprocess-supervision pattern factored into the shared
  `subprocess_tick::SubprocessTickWorker` helper (220 lines + 5
  tokio tests covering name, shutdown, nonzero-exit propagation,
  spawn-failure, 5-min kill-after timeout). Python module stays
  the implementation through v1.x; v2.0.0 cut reimplements the
  Sublime Music / Delfin / Thunar config writer in Rust under
  this module.
- [✓] **B.5 `workers/remmina_sync.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/remmina_sync.rs` ships the same
  shape pointing at `python3 -m mackes.remmina_sync` on the same
  60 s cadence. Reuses `SubprocessTickWorker`. Phase 2.0.0 cut
  reimplements the xml-writer surface in Rust.
- [✓] **B.6 `workers/ansible_pull.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/ansible_pull.rs` supervises the
  external `ansible-pull` binary on a 900 s cadence (matches the
  legacy `mackes-ansible-pull.timer` `OnUnitActiveSec=15min`).
  Reads the playbook URL from `$MDE_ANSIBLE_PULL_URL` (Phase 0.6
  MDE_-prefixed env var). Spawn failures + non-zero exits flow
  through the supervisor's `OnFailure` restart policy. mackes/
  fleet.py's subprocess-scheduling responsibilities collapse into
  this worker; the Python module's library surface stays for the
  Workbench panels that import it.
- [✓] **B.7 `workers/kdc_bridge.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/kdc_bridge.rs` ships `KdcBridgeWorker`
  conforming to the Phase A.2 `Worker` trait. Reparents the existing
  `mackes-kdc` crate as an in-process worker — adds the crate as a
  mackesd dependency, polls `paired_device_ids()` every 30 s, logs
  pairing-set changes via `tracing::info!`. Pure `device_diff(prior,
  current) -> Vec<(id, op)>` helper covered by 4 set-arithmetic
  tests; 2 tokio tests cover name + shutdown propagation. Retirement
  of the standalone `mackesd-kdc-bridge.service` systemd unit
  follows on Phase B.13.
- [✓] **B.8 `workers/heartbeat.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/heartbeat.rs` reparents the existing
  `telemetry::spawn_heartbeat_worker` as an async `HeartbeatWorker`
  conforming to the Phase A.2 `Worker` trait. Bridges the supervisor's
  `ShutdownToken` to the sync `AtomicBool` the inner thread expects;
  treats unexpected exit of the inner thread as a `Recoverable` error
  so the supervisor restarts under its `OnFailure` policy.
  `ShutdownToken::from_receiver` constructor exposed `pub(crate)` for
  sibling worker unit tests. 2 tokio tests cover name + shutdown
  propagation. mackesd lib test count: 230 → 235 (with
  `--features async-services`).
- [✓] **B.9 `workers/notification_relay.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/notification_relay.rs` ships
  `NotificationRelayWorker { qnm_root, conn,
  seen: HashSet<(peer, source_id)> }`. Polls every 5 s (FUSE-safe
  vs inotify on sshfs-mounted peers); walks `<qnm_root>/<peer>/
  .qnm-notifications/*.json`, parses each via the pure
  `parse_mirrored()` helper (4 default-aware fields: source_id,
  app, title, body, urgency=1), dedupes against the in-memory
  seen-set, and inserts each unseen row into the `notifications`
  table with `origin_peer_id` set. Skips non-JSON files, malformed
  JSON, peers without a notifications dir, and missing QNM-Shared
  root — all silently. 9 tests cover the parser, seen-key shape,
  worker name, full tick + dedupe + new-file roundtrip, malformed
  / missing-dir / missing-root edge cases.
- [✓] **B.10 `workers/notifications_server.rs`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/notifications.rs` `NotificationsService`
  now holds `Option<Arc<Mutex<rusqlite::Connection>>>`. The default
  constructor stays unbound (returns the Phase A synthetic id);
  `with_store(conn)` / `open_at(path)` / `open_default()` constructors
  give it a backing connection. `Notify`: when bound, inserts into
  the `notifications` table (or updates the matching row when
  `replaces_id` is non-zero, falling through to insert if the id
  doesn't exist) and returns the rowid. `CloseNotification`: stamps
  `dismissed_at` on the matching row. Signal definitions
  (`notification_closed`, `action_invoked`) unchanged. 4 new tokio
  tests: bound vs unbound paths, replaces_id semantics + row count,
  close stamps dismissed_at. mackesd lib tests with async-services:
  268 → 272.
- [✓] **B.11 `workers/{wol,derp,nats,perf,thumbnailer}.rs`** —
  Rust ports of the five remaining `mesh_*.py` modules.
    * `wol.rs` — full pure-Rust port of `mesh_wol.py`:
      `magic_packet()` builder (6×0xFF + 16×MAC = 102 bytes),
      `normalize_mac()` accepting colon / hyphen / bare-hex form,
      `wake(mac, broadcast, port)` UDP broadcaster. 11 unit tests.
    * `perf.rs` — read-only port of `mesh_perf.py`'s probe
      surface: `kernel_module_loaded()` reads /proc/modules,
      `kernel_mode_available()` falls back to `modinfo -n
      wireguard`, `current_mtu()` reads /sys/class/net/<iface>/mtu,
      `gso_enabled()` runs `ethtool -k`. Pure `parse_gso_state()`
      + `parse_loaded_modules()` helpers cover the parsers. 7
      tests. Sysctl-write path stays on AdminSession (root).
    * `derp.rs` — port of `mesh_derp.py`'s status + render
      surface: `is_installed()` (file + exec-bit check),
      `is_running()` (systemctl is-active mackes-derper),
      `render_derp_map(region_id, name, hostname)` pure helper
      returning the JSON the DERP daemon consumes. 5 tests.
      Install / start / stop stay on AdminSession (root).
    * `nats.rs` — matching status + render surface for
      `mesh_nats.py`. `is_server_installed()`, `is_server_running()`
      (systemctl is-active mackes-nats), `render_server_config()`
      (JetStream config with control_ip), `control_url(host)`.
      6 tests. Install / start stay on AdminSession.
    * `thumbnailer.rs` — dispatch shape for the Thunar
      `.thumbnailer` invocation. `handles_path()` recognizes the
      mesh-notification `.md` extension, `supports_size()` against
      the locked size table (128/256/512), `nearest_supported_size`
      rounds down, `render()` shells out to `python3 -m
      mackes.mesh_thumbnailer` synchronously and returns a typed
      `RenderOutcome { Ok | Failed(code) | SpawnError(msg) |
      Unsupported }`. 6 tests. Cairo + Pango port lands with the
      libcosmic panel rewrite (E.7).
  mackesd lib test count with async-services: 291 → 327 (+36).
- [✓] **B.12 `mackesd serve` subcommand** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs` ships `Cmd::Serve { qnm_root,
  node_id }` (gated behind `async-services`) + the `run_serve()`
  runtime: builds a multi-threaded tokio runtime, installs the
  shared SIGTERM/SIGINT signal handler, spawns the reconcile worker
  on its own OS thread (kept on `std::thread` because rusqlite is
  sync), and polls every 250 ms for either an external shutdown
  signal or worker exit. On shutdown joins the reconcile thread.
  Future Phase B workers register alongside the reconcile thread
  via the same supervisor pattern. systemd unit's ExecStart wires
  through when the rest of Phase B + the unit file edit ship.
- [✓] **B.13 Retire 8 systemd units** — 10 unit files (the 8 named
  services + 3 paired `.timer` files) deleted from `data/systemd/`:
  mackes-clipboard-daemon, mackes-gvfsd-mesh, mackes-mdns-relay,
  mackes-remmina-sync.{service,timer}, mackes-media-sync.{service,
  timer}, mackes-ansible-pull.{service,timer}, mackesd-kdc-bridge.
  Each role now runs inside `mackesd serve` (B.12) as a worker
  registered with the Phase A.2 supervisor. `data/systemd/mackesd
  .service` ExecStart updated from `mackesd status` to `mackesd
  serve`; `RemainAfterExit=yes` removed (serve runs forever);
  comment block documents the retirement so a future reader sees
  why those files are gone.
- [✓] **B.14 Retire Python `mackes-node`** —
  `mackes/headless/cli.py` daemon branch emits a one-shot
  `[deprecated]` banner on stderr explaining that `mackes daemon`
  is retired in v2.0.0 in favor of `mded serve` (Phase B.12) and
  pointing operators at `docs/MIGRATION_TO_MACKESD.md`. The branch
  still chains through to the legacy supervisor so v1.x systemd
  units keep working through the 1.x line; the actual deletion +
  release-note callout lands when the 2.0.0 cut ships.

#### Phase C — `mackes-settingsd` worker (drop xfconf)

- [✓] **C.1 `settings/theme.rs`** — full implementation: routes
  ThemeName / ThemeIconSet / ThemeAccent / ThemeMode through
  `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface <key> <value>` (and
  the symmetric `get` for `current()`). `ThemeMode` translates
  between Mackes's `dark/light/auto` and GSettings's `prefer-dark/
  prefer-light/default` via pure helpers `mode_to_color_scheme` +
  `color_scheme_to_mode` (5 unit tests). cosmic-config + libcosmic
  token bundle wires through with Phase E.3.
- [✓] **C.2 `settings/font.rs`** — full GSettings path: routes
  FontName / FontMonospace / FontHinting / FontAntialias through
  `gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface <key> <value>` with
  matching `get` for `current()`. 2 unit tests cover the key map.
  The fontconfig `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf` rewriter +
  `fc-cache -r` invocation lands when Phase C.2's full sweep
  across non-libadwaita apps ships; today's GSettings + libadwaita
  coverage is the load-bearing path.
- [✓] **C.3 `settings/display.rs`** — DisplayBrightness shells out
  to `brightnessctl set N%` / `brightnessctl get|max` (DRM kernel
  API, X11+Wayland portable). DisplayPrimary / DisplayScale /
  DisplayNightLight / DisplayNightLightTemp persist to a
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/display.json` sidecar (read by mde-session
  on each login to re-apply via swaymsg / wlr-output-management /
  gammastep). Range validation for scale (0.5–3.0) and night-light
  temp (1000–10000 K). Pure helper `brightness_percent` covered by
  13 tests across happy + out-of-range + preserve-other-keys.
- [✓] **C.4 `settings/power.rs`** — full implementation across 5
  keys: PowerProfile shells out to `powerprofilesctl set/get`
  (routes through power-profiles-daemon DBus); PowerLidAction +
  PowerSuspendIdleBatteryS + PowerSuspendIdleAcS persist to a
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/power-prefs.json` sidecar (read by
  mde-session at login to install the matching logind drop-in +
  swayidle config); PowerPresentationMode writes / removes a
  caffeine flag file the session watches. Pure helpers
  parse_prefs_json + prefs_path + caffeine_path covered by 7
  tests including idle-timeout-doesn't-clobber-other,
  caffeine-round-trip, defaults-when-sidecar-missing.
- [✓] **C.5 `settings/notification.rs`** — full implementation
  spans 3 keys: NotificationDoNotDisturb writes / removes a
  flag file at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/notifications-dnd` (presence
  = DND on); NotificationLocation + NotificationDefaultExpireMs
  update a `notifications-prefs.json` sidecar via a
  read-modify-write helper that preserves the other key.
  `parse_dnd_state`, `parse_prefs_json`, `dnd_flag_path`,
  `prefs_path` are pure helpers covered by 9 tests including
  on-off round-trip, idempotent-off, location-doesn't-clobber-
  expire, malformed JSON falls back to default. The
  notifications_server worker (B.10) reads the same files on
  its tick to honor DND.
- [✓] **C.6 `settings/automount.rs`** — Three booleans
  (AutomountOnInsert / AutomountOpenOnMount / AutomountAutorun)
  persist to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/automount.json` via the same
  sidecar pattern. Honored by the udisks2-aware Workbench
  Removable panel + the file-manager xdg-open hook. Default
  `autorun=false` for safety per the original `thunar-volman`
  posture. 5 tests cover defaults / round-trip / preserve-other.
- [✓] **C.7 `settings/wallpaper.rs`** — WallpaperPath +
  WallpaperMode persist to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/wallpaper.json`;
  the bg applet (Phase E.2 / E1.2) watches this file via
  cosmic-config and reapplies on change. Pure helper
  `is_valid_mode` validates against the locked set
  `{stretch, fit, fill, center, tile}`; empty string treated as
  "unset, applet picks default." 6 tests including
  reject-invalid-mode.
- [✓] **C.8 `settings/keybinds.rs`** — KeybindsMap renders into
  both `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sway/config.d/mackes-bindings.conf` and
  the i3 sibling so the operator can switch compositors without
  losing customizations. Pure `render_bindings_conf(map)` emits
  `bindsym <key> <cmd>` lines sorted by key (BTreeMap) with a
  `# DO NOT EDIT` header. `current()` re-parses the sway file
  back into the map. 6 tests cover render shape + order +
  round-trip + empty + reject-wrong-key.
- [✓] **C.9 `settings/autostart.rs`** — full implementation:
  `AutostartList { ids }` payload type; `apply()` writes one
  `.desktop` file per id under `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/autostart/`
  (AutostartHidden → Hidden=true overlay, AutostartExtra →
  Hidden=false overlay). Every generated file carries
  `X-MDE-Generated=true` so `current()` can re-scan + filter
  back to our entries (vendor `.desktop` files are ignored).
  Pure helpers `autostart_dir`, `desktop_id_path`,
  `hidden_overlay_text` covered by tests. Round-trip tests use
  a process-wide `Mutex<()>` so parallel `cargo test` workers
  don't race the shared `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var. 6 tests.
- [✓] **C.10 `org.mackes.Settings` zbus service** — interface
  surface from Phase A.3 (now under
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Settings` per Phase 0.4) is fully wired:
  `Get(key)` parses to `SettingKey`, calls
  `crate::settings::current()`, JSON-encodes the result;
  `Set(key, value_json)` parses both, calls
  `crate::settings::apply()` (which validates shape, persists,
  and runs the per-applier side effect); `ListKeys()` returns
  every variant via `SettingKey::all()`; `Snapshot()` builds a
  `Snapshot` value by iterating every key + best-effort current()
  (errors silently skipped so a missing backend like brightnessctl
  doesn't break unrelated keys); `Restore(snapshot_json)`
  re-applies each entry, aborting on first failure. `Changed`
  signal definition unchanged. 4 unit tests cover known + unknown
  keys, malformed JSON rejection, service-name/object-path
  constants.
- [ ] **C.11 — v2.1+ scope (chain on CB-1.12) · Retire `mackes/xfconf_bridge.py`** + all xfconf-query
  call sites. Delete the file.
- [✓] **C.12 Retire snapshots xfconf channels** — see F.7 above.
  `create_snapshot` now dumps every MDE setting key into
  `settings.json` alongside the xfconf channel dumps; `restore_
  snapshot` re-applies via the bridge. The xfconf dumps stay
  during the transition window so existing v1.x snapshots keep
  restoring; the v2.0.0 cut deletes XFCONF_CHANNELS + the
  `_xfconf_load_dump` path.
- [✓] **C.13 Retire presets xfconf writes** — shipped
  2026-05-20. `mackes/presets.py` `apply_devices` +
  `apply_system` rewritten to route through
  `mackes.mde_settings_bridge` instead of `xfconf_bridge`:
  power profile via `bridge.power_profile_set` (lands in
  `powerprofilesctl` via the Phase C.4 Rust applier);
  workspace count via `workspace.count` key; notifications
  enable/disable via the `notification.do_not_disturb` flag
  file (the notifications_server worker honors); WM-theme
  hint becomes informational (sway uses libcosmic theme,
  not xfwm4 themes). `get_bridge` / `XfconfError` imports
  gone from both functions. 14 preset tests still green.

#### Phase D — Sway hard-switch + `mackes-session`

- [✓] **D.1 `crates/mde-session/` skeleton** — new crate (renamed
  per Phase 0.4) ships under `crates/mde-session/` with main.rs +
  session.rs + lock.rs + autostart.rs (~400 LOC). main spawns the
  compositor (default `sway`, override via `$MDE_COMPOSITOR`),
  registers `dev.mackes.MDE.Session` on the session bus, and
  blocks until SIGTERM / SIGINT / compositor-exit, then cleans up.
  session.rs implements the zbus interface for Logout / Restart /
  Shutdown / Lock / SaveLayout — Logout signals the parent via
  SIGTERM (workspace forbids unsafe, so this is via `kill -TERM
  $pid` rather than libc::kill). SaveLayout runs `swaymsg -t
  get_tree` and writes to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/session-layout.json`.
  Iced + libcosmic for the logout / restart / shutdown
  CONFIRMATION dialog (D.2) lives in a separate process so this
  binary stays Iced-free + boots fast.
- [✓] **D.2 Iced logout/restart/shutdown dialog** — shipped
  2026-05-19. New workspace member `crates/mde-logout-dialog/`
  with a dep-free library (locked title/body/button copy +
  `Action`/`Choice`/`exit_code`/`systemctl_subcommand` pure fns —
  8 unit tests) plus the Iced 0.13 binary `mde-logout-dialog`
  that renders the confirmation modal and exits 0 (Confirm) / 10
  (Cancel). Parent (mde-session) maps the exit code: 0 ⇒ run
  `systemctl_subcommand(action)` (or SIGTERM-the-session for
  Logout), 10 ⇒ noop. CLI: `mde-logout-dialog --action
  logout|restart|shutdown`. Library is Iced-free so session.rs
  unit tests run in milliseconds without Wayland or wgpu.
- [✓] **D.3 Autostart honoring** — `crates/mde-session/src/autostart.rs`
  ships pure helpers `parse_desktop_entry` (default-group parser
  that ignores comments / blank lines / non-default groups),
  `should_launch` (honors Hidden=true, OnlyShowIn=, NotShowIn=
  against the `MDE` desktop-environment name, requires Exec=),
  `strip_exec_field_codes` (drops %U/%F/%i/etc per XDG spec),
  `autostart_dirs` (user honors $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, system =
  /etc/xdg/autostart). `launch_user_autostart()` walks all dirs,
  user entries shadow system, each survivor spawned via
  `sh -c '<exec>'` detached. 7 unit tests cover the parser +
  filter + field-code stripper.
- [✓] **D.4 swaylock integration** — `crates/mde-session/src/lock.rs`
  ships `DEFAULT_LOCK_CMD = "swaylock --color 000000"`,
  `lock_command_string()` reads `$MDE_LOCK_CMD` (with
  `$MACKES_LOCK_CMD` Phase 0.6 fallback) and defaults to the
  swaylock command when unset. `run_lock_command()` spawns via
  `sh -c` so the env-var can include shell flags. 5 tests cover
  the default, env-var override, legacy fallback,
  whitespace-treated-as-unset.
- [✓] **D.5 Sway config — port `data/i3/` → `data/sway/`** —
  - `data/sway/config` (140 lines) — top-level include chain
    mirrors the i3 file shape: same Mod4 prefix, font, gaps,
    Carbon color palette, 4 persistent workspaces, focus / move
    bindings, layout switching, resize mode, `include
    ~/.config/sway/config.d/*.conf`. Differences from i3 isolated
    to: Wayland-native terminal (`foot` instead of xfce4-terminal),
    `bemenu-run` instead of dmenu_run, `app_id="^mde-*$"` window
    rules instead of `class=`.
  - `data/sway/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` (44 lines) — port of
    every i3 default hotkey: Super+Q kill, Super+W close, Super+L
    lock, Super+V clipboard, Super+E cosmic-files (with yazi +
    xdg-open fallbacks), Super+Tab switcher, F3 expose, Super+Space
    apple-menu. Adds Wayland-native screenshot bindings (grim +
    slurp) and pactl / brightnessctl XF86 multimedia-key handling.
  - `data/sway/config.d/mackes-bindings.conf` — written by
    settings::keybinds (C.8 already ships the writer; renderer
    emits both sway + i3 forms).
- [✓] **D.6 `data/systemd/mde-session.service`** — user unit
  ships at `data/systemd/mde-session.service` (renamed from the
  worklist's older `mackes-session.service` per the Phase 0.4
  rebrand lock). Type=notify so graphical-session.target waits
  for sway + the DBus surface to come up. After=mde-migrate-from-
  1x.service so the v1.x → v2.0.0 config migration (Phase 0.5)
  runs first. Restart=on-failure with 5 s back-off. Hardening
  applied: NoNewPrivileges, ProtectKernel*, RestrictNamespaces,
  LockPersonality, RestrictRealtime. `Install: WantedBy=graphical-
  session.target` so `systemctl --user enable mde-session` from
  the install hook turns it on automatically.
- [✓] **D.7 Retire `bin/mackes-enforce-session`** + `bin/mackes-wm`
  — shipped 2026-05-20 as retirement guards. Both scripts now
  short-circuit when the MDE Wayland session is active
  (`XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=MDE` OR `mde-session.service` is running
  for enforce-session; `SWAYSOCK` env var OR
  `XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=MDE` for mackes-wm). The legacy v1.x
  converge logic still fires on real v1.x sessions so the
  back-compat window stays intact. `mackes-wm` retirement output
  also points at the new paths (`swaymsg -t get_version`,
  Workbench keybinds editor, `systemctl --user status
  mde-session.service`). The actual file deletion happens at
  the v2.0.0 cut commit; until then the v1.x autostart entries
  point at scripts that no-op cleanly under MDE. 6 unit tests
  cover bash syntax + the four short-circuit branches + the
  legacy-fall-through path.

#### Phase E — Panel rewrite to Iced + libcosmic

Crate is renamed `crates/mackes-panel/` → `crates/mde-panel/` as part
of Phase 0.2 Cargo workspace rename. Every source file under the old
GTK3-based crate either ports to Iced + libcosmic or retires; the
breakdown below names every current file (`ls crates/mackes-panel/
src/`) and its destination.

- [✓] **Phase E.1.1 Cargo.toml dep swap (side-by-side variant, shipped
  2026-05-21)** — best-choice revision of the original
  "rip-and-replace mackes-panel" lock: instead of dropping GTK from
  `mackes-panel` (which would have regressed every installed v2.0.x
  box mid-Phase-E), we **add a new workspace member**
  `crates/mde-panel/` that ships the Iced + Wayland panel in
  parallel. The GTK `mackes-panel` stays on-disk + functional until
  `mde-panel` reaches feature parity at the end of Phase E. At
  that point the spec flips `/usr/bin/mackes-panel` to the
  `mde-panel` binary and `mackes-panel` retires. Deps shipped:
  `iced 0.13` (same feature set as mde-workbench / mde-files —
  wgpu+tiny-skia+tokio+advanced), `zbus 5` (tokio), `tokio 1`
  (rt-multi-thread+macros+process), `serde`, `serde_json`,
  `tracing` + `tracing-subscriber`, `clap 4.5`, plus path deps on
  `mde-config`, `mde-mesh-types`, `mde-applet-api`,
  `mackes-theme`. `smithay-client-toolkit` + `swayipc-async` are
  reserved for Phase E.2 / E.4.1 respectively (deferred so the
  skeleton compiles without heavy Wayland-dev-header dependencies
  on the build host). `libcosmic` / `cosmic-config` /
  `cosmic-theme` retired from the plan — raw Iced 0.13 +
  `mackes-theme` (E3.1, shipped) cover the Carbon-token bridge
  without dragging in COSMIC's git-only dep tree. Workspace member
  list updated.
- [✓] **Phase E.1.2 Crate skeleton (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/lib.rs` exports `App`, `Message`, `Pane`
  (6-zone top-bar lock: Start / Pinned / Tasklist / Cluster /
  Tray / Clock — `Pane::ordered()` + `Pane::label()` give callers
  a stable composition contract). `src/main.rs` is the
  `iced::application(...)` runner with a `clap`-driven CLI accepting
  `--apple-menu` / `--expose` / `--drawer` / `--recover` /
  `--root-menu` / `--focus <slug>` (each per-flag implementation
  lands at its Phase E port; the skeleton routes them all into the
  same Iced app for now). Theme defaults to `iced::Theme::Dark`
  until E.1.3 lands the mackes-theme bridge. 7 unit tests cover
  pane ordering / labels / hash / app default / tick semantics /
  noop idempotence / tick saturation. `cargo check --workspace`
  green; `cargo test -p mde-panel` → 7/0/0.
- [✓] **Phase E.1.3 mackes-theme adapter init (revised from
  libcosmic, shipped 2026-05-21)** — superseded by the Path A
  decision: `mackes-theme::parse_tokens` (E3.1, shipped) parses
  `data/css/tokens.css` into a `TokenTable`; `App::theme()` consumes
  it directly to build an `iced::Theme::custom(...)`. The libcosmic
  detour is gone — raw Iced + mackes-theme is enough for the
  Carbon accent + density overrides. Active-preset change events
  wire to the existing `mackes-theme::accent_override` hook.
  Implementation lands inline as part of E.1.2 (this skeleton)
  + the E.2 layer-shell wrapper. Phase E.1 closure now means:
  `mde-panel` boots as an Iced window with the Mackes accent
  applied, ready for E.2 to anchor it to the bottom edge.
- [✓] **Phase E.2 layer-shell anchor + strut (shipped 2026-05-21)**
  — `crates/mde-panel/src/layer_shell.rs` ships the
  configuration data model: `AnchorConfig { edge, layer,
  height_px, exclusive_zone, keyboard, namespace }` with
  preset constructors `bottom_panel()` (40px bottom-edge,
  Layer::Top, exclusive_zone on, OnDemand keyboard, namespace
  `mde-panel`), `watermark()` (Background layer, no exclusive
  zone, no keyboard, `mde-watermark`), `drawer()` (Right edge,
  Top layer, OnDemand keyboard, `mde-drawer`). `exclusive_zone
  _px(cfg)` returns the strut size. 7 unit tests lock every
  config field. The actual SCTK `wlr_layer_shell_v1` integration
  (the `iced::application` wrapper that consumes these configs)
  lands when the iced_layershell community crate stabilizes or
  the workspace adopts direct SCTK — captured as a follow-up.
- [ ] **Phase E.2 follow-up: iced_layershell integration — v2.1+ scope (Iced version cascade)**
  — investigated 2026-05-21. `iced_layershell` is at 0.18.x on
  crates.io and wraps a newer Iced version (likely 0.14+) that
  conflicts with the workspace's pinned Iced 0.13 (shared
  across mde-panel, mde-workbench, mde-files, mde-logout-dialog,
  10+ applet crates). Adopting iced_layershell would force a
  workspace-wide Iced 0.13 → 0.14+ bump, which is a substantial
  refactor that doesn't gate v2.0.0 ship.
  Pragmatic v2.0.0 path: the panel renders as a regular Iced
  window (acceptable in dev + via XDG portal positioning). The
  `AnchorConfig` data model (Phase E.2, shipped) is the
  contract the eventual integration consumes.
  Alternative path (direct SCTK without iced_layershell):
  hand-roll a `wlr_layer_shell_v1` client using
  `smithay-client-toolkit 0.19` (already in the workspace
  Cargo.lock via mde-files), bypass Iced's window-management
  layer, present its surface directly. ~400 LOC of SCTK glue.
  Both paths scheduled for v2.1.
- [✓] **Phase E.3 foreign-toplevel listener data model
  (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/toplevels.rs` ships the data model that
  the SCTK `wlr_foreign_toplevel_management_v1` subscription
  populates: `Toplevel { id, title, app_id, state }` +
  `ToplevelState { focused, fullscreen, minimized, maximized }`
  + `ToplevelEvent { Added, Updated, Removed, Disconnected }` +
  `ToplevelModel` (in-memory HashMap of every observed window
  with `apply()`, `ordered()`, `focused()`, `filter()`
  accessors). Pure `focus_change_events(model, new_focus)`
  computes the events needed to flip focus from the previous
  focused window to a new id. 12 unit tests cover empty start,
  add/update/remove/disconnect events, ordered iteration,
  focus_change_events no-op + 2-event flip. The actual SCTK
  subscription that emits these events into an Iced channel
  lands alongside E.2's surface integration (one path-dep on
  iced_layershell or direct SCTK away).
- [✓] **Phase E.4.1 sway_cluster (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  closed by the applet-driven Cluster zone. The Cluster pane's
  default binding (`host::default_bindings`) points at
  `mde-applet-status-cluster` (E1.2.10, shipped 2026-05-20)
  which renders the battery + power-profile pill. The SPLIT /
  LAYOUT / WINDOW sway-IPC chips remain pending as a follow-up
  (a dedicated cluster applet that subscribes to swayipc-async
  EventStream(Window, Workspace)) — captured below.
- [✓] **Phase E.4.1 follow-up: sway-cluster applet (shipped
  2026-05-21)** — new workspace member
  `crates/mde-applets/sway-cluster/` ships
  `mde-applet-sway-cluster` as a polling chip applet. Pure
  `parse_get_tree_focus(json)` walks the sway `get_tree` output
  to the focused leaf, traces its `workspace`/`con` ancestry,
  and emits a `ClusterRow { split, layout, window }`. Glyph
  helpers `split_glyph(layout)` map sway's `splith`/`splitv`/
  `tabbed`/`stacked` to single-character chips (H/V/T/S);
  `layout_glyph(layout)` collapses workspace layouts to
  `def`/`tab`/`stk`. The binary spawns `swaymsg -t get_tree`,
  feeds the JSON to the parser, prints the chip row, exits 0.
  `--manifest` mode emits the applet-api JSON manifest. The
  panel host's `default_bindings()` flipped the `Pane::Cluster`
  binding from the status-cluster placeholder to
  `mde-applet-sway-cluster`. 10 unit tests cover empty-row
  rendering, glyph mapping (known + unknown + empty), garbage
  JSON fallthrough, no-focused-window case, full focused-leaf
  walk, tabbed-workspace path. 1.1.0 layout lock preserved.
  Eventual subscription-based variant (instead of 2s polling)
  lands when swayipc-async is wired into the panel host.
- [✓] **Phase E.4.2 hero (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/hero.rs` ships `Hero` with
  `current`/`incoming` slide state, `set_focused(title, app_id)`,
  `tick(now)` promotion at the 280ms boundary, `progress_at(now)`
  for renderer-driven opacity/transform, `display_title()` with
  Unicode-safe ellipsization at 64 chars. The sway focus
  `EventStream(Window::Focus)` subscription that calls
  `set_focused()` lands when Phase E.3 wires foreign-toplevel
  events; the widget today drives off the demo state in
  `TopBarState`. 12 unit tests cover slide duration lock,
  set-focused no-op on same entry, tick promotion, ellipsize,
  progress 0→1 ramp, Unicode safety, max-title char count.
- [✓] **Phase E.4.3 — superseded by E1.2.11 `mde-applet-app-switcher` (2026-05-20).** The Iced port of the Super+Tab switcher ships as a standalone applet binary (7 tests). Panel-host consumption is gated separately on Phase E.1 (the wholesale GTK→Iced rewrite of mackes-panel) — the applet itself is complete. Original entry: Super+Tab switcher
  popup. Reads candidates from the E.3 foreign-toplevel
  subscription, renders an Iced centered overlay window
  (`Layer::Overlay`), focus on Super-release via
  `swayipc-async::Connection::run_command`. Pure-fn cycling
  helpers (`cycle_forward` / `cycle_back` / `commit_selection`)
  ported as-is with their existing tests.
- [✓] **Phase E.4.4 expose (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/expose.rs` ships the pure-fn helpers:
  `grid_columns(n)` (ceil-sqrt capped at MAX_COLUMNS=6),
  `card_layout(surface_w, surface_h, n)` (16:9 aspect with
  height-based fallback), `truncate_title(s, max)` (Unicode-
  safe ellipsis), `cards_from_windows(windows)` (filters
  window_type=="normal", maps to ExposeCard). The Iced
  fullscreen overlay UI + swaymsg [con_id=N] focus click handler
  land alongside the Phase E.3 foreign-toplevel listener; the
  layout math today is testable in isolation. 11 unit tests.
- [✓] **Phase E.5 clipboard via wl-clipboard (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  best-choice deviation from the original "SCTK
  wlr-data-control" lock: `crates/mde-panel/src/clipboard.rs`
  wraps `wl-paste` + `wl-copy` (the canonical command-line
  interface to wlr-data-control on every wlroots compositor).
  ~50 LOC of subprocess wrappers replaces ~500 LOC of SCTK
  protocol boilerplate with identical user-visible behavior.
  `paste_text()`, `copy_text(s)`, `available_mime_types()`,
  `toggle_mute()`-style helpers; `ClipEntry` + `parse_clipboard_
  history(json)` for the mesh-replicated cache at
  `~/.cache/mde/clipboard.json` (unchanged). 8 unit tests cover
  history parse round-trips + malformed/empty fallthrough +
  no-panic on absent wl-paste/wl-copy. B.1 supervised Python
  clipboard daemon retires once mded's clipboard worker also
  flips to wl-paste subscription.
- [✓] **Phase E.6.1 brightness slider (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/sliders.rs` ships `read_brightness_
  percent()` + `set_brightness_percent(pct)` routed through
  `brightnessctl get|max|set N%`. The 7-step snap helpers
  (`STOPS = [0,14,28,42,57,71,85,100]`, `snap_to_step`,
  `step_index`) replace the X11 `xrandr --brightness` path
  per the 1.x version's slider math. The drawer (E.8) and start
  menu (E.11 applet, shipped) consume these helpers when their
  quick-action slider widgets render.
- [✓] **Phase E.6.2 volume slider (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  best-choice deviation from "pipewire-rs": `crates/mde-panel/
  src/sliders.rs` ships `read_volume_percent()`,
  `set_volume_percent(pct)`, `read_mute()`, `toggle_mute()`
  routed through `pactl` (PipeWire's PA compat layer — the same
  pactl path the audio applet E1.2.2 uses, so the workspace
  stays one volume-control story). Pure helpers
  `parse_pactl_volume(output)` + `parse_pactl_mute(output)`
  isolate the parsing for tests. 8 unit tests across snap +
  step index + pactl parsers + no-panic on absent binary. The
  bindgen blocker that retired pipewire-rs in the audio
  applet's revision applies the same way here.
- [✓] **Phase E.7.1 — superseded by E1.2.5 `mde-applet-notification-bell` (2026-05-20).** Iced badge widget reading the unread count from ~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json (the same source mded would emit via UnreadCount() once B.10 wires the method). 8 tests. Panel-host placement between status cluster and clock is gated on Phase E.1 panel rewrite. Original entry: tray button
  between status cluster and clock. Reads unread count from
  `mded` via `dev.mackes.MDE.Notifications.GetCapabilities`
  + a custom `UnreadCount()` method (added to B.10
  notifications_server). Iced badge widget capped at `99+`;
  `pulsing` CSS class replaced by an Iced color animation.
- [✓] **Phase E.7.2 — superseded by E1.2.6 `mde-applet-notifications` (2026-05-20).** Iced notifications-center reader ships as a standalone overlay binary parsing ~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json, grouping by peer, marking unread with bullet glyph. 9 tests. The 2 s live refresh + per-card actions are gated on the panel-host wiring (Phase E.1). Original entry: 960×640 Iced
  modal window. Reads `~/.cache/mde/notifications.json` (mesh-
  replicated by B.9). Header (title + unread/total + Clear-all)
  + LATEST + per-node tree + per-card actions (mark read / copy /
  dismiss). 2 s live refresh while open via
  `time::every(2.seconds())`.
- [✓] **Phase E.8.1 mde-drawer scaffold (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  new workspace member `crates/mde-drawer/` ships:
  * `Cargo.toml` — iced 0.13 (same feature set as mde-workbench)
    + serde + tracing + path dep on `mde-panel`.
  * Lib `mde_drawer` — `DRAWER_WIDTH_PX=360`, `SLIDE_DURATION_MS
    =280`, `DrawerSection` enum (QuickActions / Sliders /
    Notifications / Hardware) with ordered() + label(),
    `QuickToggle` enum (DoNotDisturb / Caffeine / NightLight /
    Airplane) with flag_path / is_on / set roundtrip,
    `NotificationRow` + `parse_notifications` + `unread_only`
    helpers reading the same JSON cache the standalone
    notification-center applet consumes.
  * Bin `mde-applet-drawer` — minimal Iced shell that lays out
    the four sections vertically with placeholder bodies.
  * Workspace member added. 12 unit tests cover width / slide-
    duration locks, section ordering + labels, quick-toggle
    flag-path layout, on/off round-trip + idempotent-off,
    notification parser empty + round-trip + unread filter.
- [✓] **Phase E.8.2 drawer sections (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  data layer for each of the four sections ships alongside
  E.8.1:
  * **Quick Actions:** 4 toggles (DND / Caffeine / NightLight
    / Airplane) each backed by a flag-file under
    `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/<stem>`. is_on / set helpers wrap
    `Path::exists` / `std::fs::write` / `std::fs::remove_file`
    with idempotent-off semantics.
  * **Sliders:** consumed from `mde_panel::sliders` (the same
    `read_brightness_percent` / `read_volume_percent` /
    `set_volume_percent` / `toggle_mute` helpers that shipped
    at E.6.1 / E.6.2). The drawer view function pulls the
    current value once per render frame.
  * **Notifications:** `parse_notifications(json)` reads the
    same `~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json` cache the
    standalone applet uses; `unread_only(rows)` filters
    dismissed entries.
  * **Hardware:** upower-over-zbus surface deferred to the
    drawer's first widget pass (data model is `WatermarkState`-
    style and lands alongside the rendered widget; placeholder
    body in the bin shows the intent).
  Total drawer tests: 12 (covers all 4 sections' data layer).
- [✓] **Phase E.9 dock_dnd data model (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/dock_dnd.rs` ships pure-fn drop
  routing: `PinnedEntry { desktop_id, label }`,
  `reorder_dock(pinned, from, to)`, `pin_app(pinned, new,
  at_index)` (rejects duplicates), `unpin(pinned, desktop_id)`,
  + `DragSource { DockSlot, Tasklist }` with namespaced atom
  names (`mde-dock-launcher-pos` / `mde-tasklist-pin`). 12
  unit tests cover forward / backward / to-end / same-index
  reorders, source/dest out-of-range errors, pin append /
  insert-at-index / duplicate rejection, unpin remove /
  no-op-when-missing, atom-name v2-namespace lock. The Iced
  drag-source + drop-target widget integration (which calls
  these helpers from gesture events) lands when the dock
  applet adds drag recognition.
- [✓] **Phase E.10 — superseded by E1.2.7 `mde-applet-dock` (2026-05-20).** Bottom taskbar applet ships as standalone Iced binary parsing swaymsg `get_tree` for running windows + ~/.config/mde/dock-pinned (TSV `desktop_id\tlabel`) for pinned launchers, renders pinned-not-running as `[· label]` then running with focus/urgent/pinned markers. 9 tests. Right-click admin_menu / icon_mapper popups + drag-to-reorder are gated on the panel-host wiring (Phase E.1) + Phase E.9. Original entry: the actual
  bottom taskbar widget. Reads pinned launchers from
  `~/.config/mde/panel.toml` (via `mackes-config`, will rename
  to `mde-config`) and running windows from the E.3 foreign-
  toplevel subscription. Right-click → E.13 admin_menu /
  E.19 icon_mapper popups. Drag source for E.9 reordering.
- [✓] **Phase E.11 start_menu (shipped 2026-05-21)** — closed
  via the applet-host pattern. `crates/mde-applets/start-menu/`
  (E1.2.8, shipped 2026-05-20) is the standalone Iced popover
  binary; `crates/mde-panel/src/host.rs::default_bindings`
  routes `Pane::Start` clicks to `mde-applet-start-menu` so
  clicking the Start glyph in the panel spawns the popover as
  a child process. Quick Actions + Toggles + Volume +
  7-step Brightness slot into the drawer (E.8) per the
  revised "spirit of ask" split, not into the Start menu
  itself — kept as `[ ] Open` follow-up below.
- [✓] **Phase E.12 apple_menu (shipped 2026-05-21)** — closed
  via the applet-host pattern. `crates/mde-applets/apple-menu/`
  (E1.2.9, shipped 2026-05-20) is the standalone Spotlight-
  style Iced popover; `crates/mde-panel/src/host.rs::
  applet_for_subcommand(SubCommand::AppleMenu)` maps to
  `mde-applet-apple-menu`. `mde-panel --apple-menu` spawns
  + waits on the applet (wired in main.rs). Super+Space sway
  bind invokes `mde-panel --apple-menu` per data/sway/config.d/
  mackes-defaults.conf.
- [✓] **Phase E.13 admin_menu (shipped 2026-05-21)** — Iced port
  shipped at `crates/mde-panel/src/admin_menu.rs`. Pure-data
  `SECTIONS` const preserves the Q15-locked 9 actions across 5
  sections (Shells / Packages / Services / Security / Storage).
  `build_foot_argv(action)` returns the argv that spawns the
  action under `foot --hold --title "MDE admin · <label>"`;
  `spawn_action()` does the std::process::Command::spawn. Sudo-
  cached probe carries over from the GTK version. 9 unit tests
  cover action count lock + section names + needs-sudo flags +
  argv shape + compound-command preservation.
- [✓] **Phase E.14 root_menu (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/root_menu.rs` ships the 4-item locked
  action set as a `RootMenuAction` enum (ChangeWallpaper /
  OpenMeshShare / SendFileToPeer(peer) / DisplaySettings).
  `discover_peers()` walks `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/` (sorted,
  skips dotfiles + non-directories). `build_menu(qnm_root)`
  returns the full menu = 4 fixed + per-peer SendTo entries.
  Each action's `argv(qnm_root)` returns the spawn vector
  (Send-To now routes through `mde-files --send-to <peer-dir>`
  instead of the X11-only zenity picker the 1.x version used).
  9 unit tests cover labels + argv shape + peer discovery
  (sorted / hidden-skip / missing-dir / file-skip) + menu
  assembly + default QNM root resolver.
- [✓] **Phase E.15 status_cluster (shipped 2026-05-21)** — closed
  via tray applets. `mde-applet-status-cluster` (E1.2.10,
  shipped 2026-05-20) renders the battery + power-profile pill;
  the panel host's `tray_applets()` mounts it as the last
  Tray-zone applet. Click target hand-off `mde --focus <slug>`
  routes through the panel's `--focus` CLI surface (also wired
  in main.rs this commit).
- [✓] **Phase E.16 network_manager (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  closed via tray applets. `mde-applet-network` (E1.2.3,
  shipped 2026-05-20) is the standalone nmcli-backed chip;
  the panel host's `tray_applets()` mounts it as the 2nd
  Tray-zone applet. Click target `mde --focus network.wifi`
  routes through the panel's `--focus` CLI hand-off.
- [✓] **Phase E.17 top_bar — 2026 visual chrome (shipped 2026-05-21)**
  — `crates/mde-panel/src/top_bar.rs` ships the panel's six-zone
  layout as the foundation every other port slots into. Lays out
  Start / Pinned / Tasklist / Cluster / Tray / Clock with
  symmetric 12px zone padding and flexible spacers between
  groups. **2026 design language locks:** dark-glass surface
  (96% alpha at the base, hairline top edge in 18% alpha
  background-strong), accent system tied to the mackes-theme
  bridge (E.1.3), Red-Hat-Mono clock at 14px, microinteraction-
  ready zone styling (`zone_style` placeholder gets per-zone
  hover state in E.7+). `TopBarState::demo()` populates every
  zone with reasonable placeholders so the Iced binary boots
  with content. `format_clock(epoch)` is pure for tests; the
  weather-popover surface ships as a follow-up worklist item
  alongside the clock applet panel-host wiring. 9 unit tests.
- [✓] **Phase E.17 follow-up: weather popover (shipped
  2026-05-21)** — `crates/mde-panel/src/weather.rs` ships
  `WeatherSnapshot { location, condition, temp_c, high_c, low_c,
  wind_kmh, fetched_at_ms }` + `render_lines()` (4-line column
  per the locked spec) + `attribution()` (footer text). Pure
  `freshness_label(fetched_ms, now_ms)` computes the human-
  readable "Updated N min ago" label across just-now / minutes /
  hours / days bands. `parse(json)` ingests the public
  `wttr.in?format=j1` shape; `save_cached(path, &snap)` +
  `load_cached(path)` round-trip our own serde format under
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/weather.json`. `POLL_INTERVAL_SECS=1800`
  matches the v1.x cadence. 14 unit tests cover render shape,
  freshness label bands, wttr.in parser (with + without region),
  malformed JSON fallthrough, cache round-trip, default path
  shape, never-updated label.
- [✓] **Phase E.18 watermark (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/watermark.rs` ships `WatermarkState`
  (MDE version / Fedora release / build hash / hostname /
  pending-update count) + `render_line()` which formats the
  single-line label (empty when no updates pending → widget
  hides). Pure helpers `parse_os_release_field` +
  `parse_count_file` are tested in isolation. The Iced widget
  itself renders into a separate Layer::Background surface as
  part of Phase E.2 layer-shell wiring; the data layer ships
  ready-to-consume today. 9 unit tests cover render shape,
  field omission rules, os-release parser, count parser
  (missing / integer / garbage), and load() no-panic.
- [✓] **Phase E.19 icon_mapper (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/icon_mapper.rs` ships
  `builtin_map()` (HashMap of ~50 fdo icon-name → Carbon
  glyph entries: browsers / terminals / editors / files /
  media / mail / office / chat / mackes/MDE / generics),
  `resolve(fdo_name)` (case-insensitive lookup with
  fallback to "application"), `resolve_with_override(name)`
  (reads `~/.local/share/applications/<name>.desktop` for
  `X-MDE-Icon=` first), `override_path()`, `parse_override()`,
  `upsert_icon_line()`, and `write_override(name, glyph)`
  (creates the file or preserves other keys when updating).
  The Iced popover itself lands when the dock applet gets a
  right-click handler — pure-fn data layer ships ready-to-
  consume. 11 unit tests cover builtin lookup + case-
  insensitivity + fallback + override parser + upsert
  (replace + append) + round-trip.
- [✓] **Phase E.20 toasts (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/toasts.rs` ships `Toast` (kind / body /
  created_at / visible_for) + `ToastStack` (bounded queue with
  FIFO eviction at `STACK_LIMIT=3`). `ToastKind` enum carries
  Info / Success / Warn / Error severity; `Toast::{info,
  success, warn, error}` constructors set the default 2s
  visibility window. `retain_unexpired(now)` is the tick-driven
  reaper. 10 unit tests cover constructor → kind mapping,
  expiry semantics, stack push + eviction order, retain
  removes expired, default-visible-ms lock, stack-limit lock.
- [✓] **Phase E.21 mesh_module + mesh_sync (shipped 2026-05-21)**
  — closed via tray applets. `mde-applet-mesh-status` (E1.2.4,
  shipped 2026-05-20) is the standalone `mded healthz`-backed
  chip with health-glyph + peer-count; mounted as the 3rd
  Tray-zone applet in `tray_applets()`. Click target
  `mde --focus network.mesh.<peer>` routes through the panel's
  `--focus` CLI hand-off.
- [✓] **Phase E.22 recents (shipped 2026-05-21)** — closed via
  the standalone `mde-applet-recents` (E1.2.13, shipped
  2026-05-20) which exposes the XDG recently-used.xbel parser
  + top-N-by-mtime accessor. The start-menu applet (E1.2.8)
  imports `mde_applet_recents` as a library dep when it wants
  to surface the footer; the panel's spawn pattern in `host.rs`
  also supports invoking it directly via
  `host::spawn_by_binary("mde-applet-recents")`.
- [✓] **Phase E.23 desktop_files (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  closed via the start-menu applet (E1.2.8). Its `.desktop`
  parser walks `/usr/share/applications/` + `$XDG_DATA_HOME/
  applications/` and powers the all-apps list + the search
  index. No panel-side duplicate needed — the parser lives in
  the applet that consumes it, matching the 2026 design's
  "one applet, one concern" split.
- [✓] **Phase E.24 recover CLI (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/recover.rs` ships `default_snapshot_root()`
  (resolves `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mde/snapshots` with fallback to
  `/var/lib/mde/snapshots`), `latest_snapshot(root)`
  (lexicographic max, dir-only, timestamp-prefixed names),
  `render_preview(root)` (plain-text rollback preview citing
  the snapshot dir + manifest.json presence), and `run()` which
  prints + exits. Wired into `main.rs::Cli::recover` so
  `mde-panel --recover` prints to stdout and exits 0. 6 unit
  tests cover empty root / lexicographic ordering / missing
  manifest call-out / complete snapshot / file-skip / default
  root path shape.
- [✓] **Phase E.25 — `src/logout_dialog.rs` retired (shipped 2026-05-20).** Deleted the 255-line GTK toplevel module from mackes-panel. start_menu.rs `ActionCommand::LogoutDialog` now spawns `mde-logout-dialog` as a subprocess (the stand-alone Iced binary shipped by D.2). 221 mackes-panel tests + the `sign_out_routes_through_logout_dialog` lock still pass. Original entry: superseded by
  the already-shipped `crates/mde-logout-dialog/` (D.2). Delete
  the GTK module; main panel routes Power → mde-logout-dialog
  subprocess.
- [✓] **Phase E.26 config_store (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  closed by `mde-config` (the renamed `mackes-config` crate
  per Phase 0.2 alias). It's already a path-dep in
  `crates/mde-panel/Cargo.toml` and ships the typed
  `~/.config/mde/panel.toml` schema (pinned-apps order +
  recents cache + window-history). The on-disk format is
  identical to v1.x so config migrates without conversion via
  `bin/mde-migrate-from-1x` (Phase 0.5, shipped).
- [✓] **Phase E.27 test_env retire (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  via the Path A side-by-side decision the new mde-panel crate
  never carries the GTK test serializer (`try_init_gtk_serialized`
  + `env_lock`). All 64 tests across mde-panel run as plain
  `#[test]`s with no shared global state — Iced's pure-fn surface
  doesn't need the GTK Main loop. The legacy `mackes-panel`'s
  `test_env.rs` stays in place for its 221 GTK tests until that
  crate retires at end of Phase E.
- [✓] **Phase E.28 Sub-binaries (shipped 2026-05-21)** —
  `crates/mde-panel/src/main.rs` clap CLI accepts every locked
  flag and routes through `host::applet_for_subcommand` →
  `host::spawn_by_binary`. `--apple-menu` → mde-applet-apple-
  menu, `--expose` → mde-applet-expose, `--drawer` →
  mde-applet-drawer, `--root-menu` → mde-applet-root-menu,
  `--focus <slug>` → mde-workbench --focus <slug>, `--recover`
  → in-process `recover::run()`. Spawn pattern: child is
  awaited via `child.wait()` so the parent shell sees the
  applet's exit code; spawn-failure logs via tracing + exits
  cleanly so a missing applet doesn't crash the user's sway
  binding. Subcommand integration tests live alongside the
  `host::tests::applet_for_subcommand_maps_every_variant`
  + `spawn_by_binary_fails_for_missing_binary` coverage.
- [✓] **Phase E.29 layer-shell smoke test (shipped 2026-05-21)**
  — split into two halves per the Hardware Testing epic:
  * **Source-tree gate (this commit):** the panel's library
    `cargo test -p mde-panel` runs 144 pure-Iced tests covering
    every layer_shell::AnchorConfig field, toplevels event-fold
    semantics, top_bar layout, every Phase E port surface.
    No headless-Wayland dep — runs in any CI.
  * **Bench gate (HW-3):** the `WLR_BACKENDS=headless` sway
    smoke (formerly framed as CB-7.3 / I.3) lives in the
    Hardware Testing epic at the bottom of this worklist.
    Boots headless sway, launches mde-panel, asserts a
    layer-shell surface appears + a foreign-toplevel listener
    registers — runs on the bench cadence, never gates the
    cut.

#### Phase E1 — Applet workspace split

- [✓] **Phase E1.1 `crates/mde-applets/applet-api/` (shipped
  2026-05-20)** — new workspace member shipped. Pure
  cross-binary contract: `AppletId` (validated parser,
  lowercase-kebab), `AppletManifest` (id / binary / slot /
  summary / version — serde JSON), `AppletSlot` (5-value
  enum with kebab-case serde), `AppletState`, `HostMessage`
  (Accent / Visibility / Shutdown — tagged "kind" enum),
  `Applet` trait with id() + handle_host(). 7 unit tests
  covering id validation, slot serde, manifest round-trip,
  host-message tag format. Iced-flavored dep tree
  (Iced 0.13 wgpu/tiny-skia/tokio/advanced) matching the
  workbench + mde-files crates so the workspace dep
  resolution stays one tree.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.1 `crates/mde-applets/clock/` (shipped
  2026-05-20)** — clock + date pill applet binary in the
  top-bar-center slot. `mde-applet-clock --manifest` emits
  the JSON manifest (for RPM `%install` to generate
  `/usr/share/mde/applets/clock.json`); `--now` prints the
  current clock string; default mode reads `HostMessage`
  JSON lines from stdin + emits rendered clock strings to
  stdout (the host-protocol contract from
  mde-applet-api). Pure `format_clock(epoch_seconds)`
  helper using Howard-Hinnant civil-from-days (same
  algorithm the run-history + mesh-history panels use).
  5 unit tests + workspace builds clean.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.2 `crates/mde-applets/audio/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — top-bar-right audio chip, pactl-backed (PipeWire's PA compat layer — bindgen blocker lifted by shelling out instead of subscribing): parse_volume averages per-channel %, parse_mute yes/no/true, audio_glyph picks muted/zero/low/high speaker glyph, format_chip renders as `<glyph> 60%` or `<glyph> muted`; 10 tests. Note: revised away from pipewire-rs bindgen — pactl gives the same data over a 2 s tick the panel host drives. Original entry:** — pipewire-rs
  subscription for active sink + mute state; click opens the
  pavucontrol-equivalent (eventually a native Iced mixer; ships
  with `pavucontrol-qt` as Recommends in v2.0.0).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.3 `crates/mde-applets/network/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — nmcli-backed top-bar-right chip; 9 tests. Original entry:** — NM applet
  (split from E.16). Subscribes to NM's
  `org.freedesktop.NetworkManager.StateChanged` signal.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.4 `crates/mde-applets/mesh-status/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — `mded healthz`-backed chip with health-glyph + peer-count; 7 tests. Original entry:** — mesh chip
  applet (split from E.21). Polls `mded healthz` over zbus on
  a 5 s tick.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.5 `crates/mde-applets/notification-bell/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — unread-count badge from ~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json; 8 tests. Original entry:** — bell
  tray applet (split from E.7.1). Connects to mded's
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Notifications.UnreadCount`.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.6 `crates/mde-applets/notifications/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — notification-center reader: parse ~/.cache/mackes/notifications.json, filter dismissed, group by peer (BTreeMap) with newest-first within group, bullet-marker unread rows; 9 tests. Original entry:** —
  notification-center modal (split from E.7.2).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.7 `crates/mde-applets/dock/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — taskbar applet: parse swaymsg get_tree windows + ~/.config/mde/dock-pinned (TSV `desktop_id\tlabel`), render pinned-not-running as `[· label]` then running with focus/urgent/pinned markers; 9 tests. Original entry:** — taskbar applet
  (split from E.10).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.8 `crates/mde-applets/start-menu/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — Win10 Start popover: .desktop parser, pinned-favorites TSV parser, all-apps alpha-sort (hidden filtered), pinned-pane builder (orphan-drop), search (case-insensitive substring of name+comment, surfaces hidden too); 12 tests. Original entry:** — start popover
  (split from E.11).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.9 `crates/mde-applets/apple-menu/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — Super+Space Spotlight popover: app row parser, weighted scorer (exact-name 1000 → starts-with 700 → name-contains 500 → comment 200 → exec-basename 100), tiny math evaluator (recursive-descent +/-/*/(), top-score Hit, format_hits with kind-glyphs (▶/↺/=); 14 tests. Original entry:** — Super+Space
  popover (split from E.12).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.10 `crates/mde-applets/status-cluster/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — battery+power-profile pill via /sys/class/power_supply + powerprofilesctl; 11 tests. Original entry:** —
  status chip cluster (split from E.15).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.11 `crates/mde-applets/app-switcher/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — Super+Tab strip from `swaymsg -t get_tree`; pure tree-walker + format_strip; 7 tests. Original entry:** — Super+Tab
  switcher (split from E.4.3).
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.12 `crates/mde-applets/bg/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — swaybg wrapper applet reading wallpaper.path sidecar; 8 tests. Original entry:** — wallpaper layer-
  shell background applet. Honors `wallpaper.path` + `.mode`
  from the C.7 settings sidecar.
- [✓] **Phase E1.2.13 `crates/mde-applets/recents/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — recently-used.xbel reader with top-N by modified DESC; 8 tests. Original entry:** — recents widget
  (split from E.22).
- [✓] **Phase E1.3 panel-host applet discovery (shipped 2026-05-20) — `mde_applet_api::discovery` module: walks `/usr/share/mde/applets/*.json` (system) + `$XDG_DATA_HOME/mde/applets/*.json` (per-user override), validates each manifest (id regex + binary path + non-empty version + path-traversal guard), returns deduped manifest set with user shadowing system; 9 tests. Note: revised from .desktop-file shape (original spec) to JSON-manifest shape consistent with the rest of the applet-api contract. Original entry:** — `crates/mde-panel/
  src/host.rs` (new). At startup walks
  `~/.local/share/mde/applets/*.desktop` +
  `/usr/share/mde/applets/*.desktop` (system applets shipped by
  RPM), launches each as a sub-process, shares a zbus session
  connection over an env-passed bus address. Applets register
  their preferred pane (start / pinned / tasklist / cluster /
  tray / clock) via `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.RegisterApplet`. 6
  tests cover the desktop-file parser + the pane router.

#### Phase E2 — OSD overlays (cosmic-osd pattern)

- [✓] **Phase E2.1 `crates/mde-applets/volume-osd/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — transient bottom-center OSD bar with glyph + 20-cell progress bar + muted state; 11 tests. Original entry:** — Iced binary.
  Subscribes to pipewire-rs `Node` events; on volume change
  pops a 200×60 centered overlay on `Layer::Overlay` showing
  the current volume + mute glyph; auto-hides after 2 s via
  `time::sleep`. Pure-fn `format_volume_label(percent)` covered
  by 4 tests. Bound to XF86AudioRaiseVolume / Lower / Mute via
  the sway config (D.5).
- [✓] **Phase E2.2 `crates/mde-applets/brightness-osd/` (shipped 2026-05-20) — same shape as volume-osd, sun-glyph tier (low/mid/high); 7 tests. Original entry:** — same shape
  as E2.1 but for udev brightness events. Subscribes via
  `udev::Monitor` filtered to `backlight` subsystem; on event,
  reads `/sys/class/backlight/*/brightness` and renders the
  overlay. Bound to XF86MonBrightnessUp / Down.

#### Phase E3 — `mackes-theme` Carbon → cosmic-theme adapter

- [✓] **E3.1 `crates/mackes-theme/`** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  workspace member `crates/mackes-theme/` ships a dep-free
  parser for the canonical `data/css/tokens.css` GTK token
  file. `parse_tokens(css)` returns a `TokenTable` keyed by
  token name (52 tokens in the live file parse cleanly).
  `Token::as_rgb()` exposes RGBA components; `parse_hex_color`
  handles `#RGB`, `#RRGGBB`, `#RRGGBBAA` shorthand.
  `accent_override(table, hex, also_focus)` is the per-preset
  hook the panel calls before building its libcosmic theme.
  14 unit + 1 real-file integration test. The actual
  `cosmic-theme::Theme` builder is one consumer
  away — landed alongside Phase E.1 when the panel switches to
  Iced; this crate ships the data layer that builder consumes.

#### Phase F — Workbench GUI updates (Python panels switch to DBus)

- [✓] **F.1 `mackes/workbench/devices/power.py`** — rewritten to
  read + write via the new `mackes.mde_settings_bridge` module
  (routes power.lid_action / power.suspend_idle_battery_s /
  power.suspend_idle_ac_s through the
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/power-prefs.json` sidecar — the same file
  the Phase C.4 Rust applier maintains — and power profile through
  `powerprofilesctl get/set`). No XfconfBridge import. v1.x →
  v2.0.0 transition path keeps Python-side dbus client off the
  dep tree (no pydbus / dasbus); the eventual Phase E.x Iced
  panel rewrite moves the calls onto a real zbus client via the
  libcosmic + pyo3 bridge. New bridge module
  `mackes/mde_settings_bridge.py` covered by 12 tests in
  `tests/test_mde_settings_bridge.py` exercising every Phase C
  key, sidecar round-trip, malformed JSON handling, unknown-key
  rejection.
- [✓] **F.2 `mackes/workbench/system/removable.py`** — full
  rewrite to the MDE bridge. The v1.x 13-switch thunar-volman
  surface collapses to 3 keys (automount.on_insert / .open_on_mount
  / .autorun) per the MDE schema; per-device-class toggles (camera,
  scanner, audio CD, DVD, graphics tablet, etc.) move to the
  application that handles each on the v2.0.0 line. No more
  XfconfBridge import; no more async_probe needed (sidecar reads
  are sub-millisecond).
- [✓] **F.3 `mackes/workbench/look_and_feel/{themes,fonts}.py`** —
  shipped 2026-05-19. Two new panels (split off from the legacy
  `appearance.py`) read / write `theme.*` (`name`, `icon_set`,
  `mode`) and `font.*` (`name`, `monospace`, `hinting`,
  `antialias`) keys through `mde_settings_bridge.set_setting`.
  No xfconf reads / writes — `XfconfBridge` import gone from
  both files. Theme + icon discovery walks the standard
  `/usr/share/themes` + `~/.themes` etc roots and dedupes. 8
  unit tests cover the discovery helpers, the bridge-only
  import contract, and the locked-MDE-key references.
- [✓] **F.4 `mackes/workbench/devices/displays.py`** — shipped
  2026-05-19. Full rewrite to MDE bridge. Reads connected outputs
  through `mackes.sway_ipc.get_outputs()` (new helper added in
  the same commit — parses `swaymsg -t get_outputs` and returns
  `[]` on any failure so a TTY login or non-sway compositor
  renders an empty state instead of crashing). Four controls
  (primary / scale / night-light on/off / night-light temp K)
  write through `mde_settings_bridge.set_setting` to the locked
  `display.primary` / `.scale` / `.night_light` / `.night_light_temp`
  keys. XfconfBridge import gone; xrandr subprocess gone.
  Brightness stays in its own worker (display.brightness via
  brightnessctl). 11 unit tests cover the discovery helper, the
  bridge-only contract, the locked-key list, and the
  `sway_ipc.get_outputs()` JSON parser (good / malformed /
  non-list / empty cases).
- [✓] **F.5 `mackes/workbench/system/notifications.py`** — full
  rewrite to `mackes.mde_settings_bridge`: Placement combo writes
  `notification.location` (5 corners); DND switch toggles the
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/notifications-dnd` flag file (same one the
  notifications_server worker honors); Default-duration spin
  writes `notification.default_expire_ms`. xfce4-notifyd-only
  knobs (fade / slide / primary-monitor / theme name) dropped —
  v2.0.0 server handles visuals via libcosmic theme tokens, not
  user toggles.
- [✓] **F.6 `mackes/workbench/system/session.py`** — full
  rewrite to the bridge for the 3 lifecycle toggles
  (session.save_on_exit / session.lock_on_suspend /
  session.auto_save). Routes through new
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/session-prefs.json` sidecar; mde-session
  reads at login. Autostart-entry list logic unchanged. No more
  XfconfBridge import.
- [✓] **F.7 `mackes/workbench/system/snapshots.py`** —
  `mackes/snapshots.py::create_snapshot` now ALSO dumps every MDE
  setting (via `mde_settings_bridge.get_setting` over the full
  `_KEY_MAP`) into a `settings.json` file alongside the xfconf
  channel dumps. `restore_snapshot` re-applies via
  `mde_settings_bridge.set_setting` after the xfconf restore.
  Tolerates partial snapshots: older snapshots without
  `settings.json` skip the MDE restore cleanly. Manifest gains
  `mde_keys: [list]` for forward audit. Workbench snapshots panel
  itself is unchanged — it calls the same
  `create_snapshot`/`restore_snapshot` API.
- [✓] **C.12 Retire snapshots xfconf channels** — the xfconf
  channel dumps stay during the v1.x → v2.0.0 transition window
  (so an existing snapshot still restores correctly on a v1.x
  box), but the v2.0.0 surface is now fully covered by the
  `settings.json` writer above. The
  `mackes/snapshots.py:30–43 XFCONF_CHANNELS` constant retires
  with the v2.0.0 cut alongside the rest of the xfconf stack.
- [✓] **F.8 `mackes/workbench/system/window_manager.py`** — new
  `mackes/sway_ipc.py` thin wrapper around swaymsg
  (is_sway_running, current_workspace, focus_workspace, set_layout,
  kill_focused, get_tree, reload_config). window_manager.py's
  `_detect_wm()` prefers sway when available (falls back to
  `wmctrl -m` for the v1.x X11 line); new `_wm_msg(...)`
  dispatcher routes layout + kill commands through sway_ipc when
  sway is the active compositor, falls back to i3-msg otherwise.
  `_i3_msg` retained as an alias so existing call sites work
  unchanged. 8 unit tests for sway_ipc cover the no-swaymsg
  fallback for every public function + the invalid-layout
  rejection helper.
- [✓] **F.9 `mackes/drawer.py:415–438`** — `_dnd_state` / `_dnd_toggle`
  + `_caffeine_state` / `_caffeine_toggle` rewritten to read +
  toggle the flag files at `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/notifications-dnd`
  and `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/power-caffeine` respectively. Same
  files the notifications_server worker + mde-session honor; the
  drawer is now consistent with the rest of the v2.0.0 surface.
  No more xfconf-query for these toggles.
- [✓] **F.10 Delete `mackes/menu_integration.py`** — file deleted.
  Call sites in `mackes/workbench/maintain/repair.py`
  (_rehide_menus, _restore_menus, _reinstall_entry) and
  `mackes/wizard/pages/apply.py::_step_menu` rewired to return a
  v2.0.0 informational no-op message; the .desktop entry is
  package-owned by the RPM (data/applications/mde.desktop).
  `tests/conftest.py` purge-set trimmed accordingly. No more
  imports of `mackes.menu_integration` anywhere in the tree.
- [✓] **F.11 `mackes/workbench/fleet/settings.py`** — new Workbench
  panel. Key picker (every entry from `mde_settings_bridge._KEY_MAP`),
  live current-value preview, JSON value entry, peer selector
  (default `all`), Apply button that shells out to `mded fleet
  push-setting <key> <value> --peers <sel>` (Phase G.4). Pure
  helper `push_setting(key, value_json, peers) -> (ok, message)`
  covered by 1 test (no-mded fallback). When `mded` isn't on PATH
  the panel renders an error_state pointing at the install path
  instead of crashing.
- [✓] **F.12 `mackes/workbench/fleet/revisions.py`** — new
  Workbench panel + matching `mded revisions` subcommand tree
  (`list [--json]`, `diff <from> <to>`, `rollback <id> --peers
  <sel>`). Lists every desired_config row newest first; each row
  has a Rollback button. Pure helpers `list_revisions() -> (rows,
  err)`, `rollback_to(id, peers)`, `format_revision_row(rev)` —
  3 tests cover the format + no-mded fallbacks. The rollback path
  writes a new desired_config row carrying the named revision's
  spec_json (immutable history per 12.2.2).

#### Phase G — Fleet-managed config layer

- [✓] **G.1 Extend `DesiredSnapshot` with `settings_keys`** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/topology.rs::DesiredSnapshot` gains a
  `settings_keys: Vec<(String, String)>` field carrying (key,
  value_json) pairs. `#[serde(default)]` so existing serialized
  snapshots round-trip; struct-literal construction sites
  (~20 spots across tests + topology fixtures) updated.
  `insta` snapshot for the default empty shape regenerated.
- [✓] **G.2 Extend `reconcile.rs`** — `settings::apply_all(pairs)
  -> Vec<ApplyOutcome>` lands in `crates/mackesd/src/settings/mod.rs`.
  Doesn't short-circuit on the first error so operators see the
  full failure picture per tick. The reconcile worker invokes
  `apply_all(&desired.settings_keys)` on every apply phase. 4 new
  tests in `settings::g2_tests` cover empty input, unknown-key,
  malformed-json, no-short-circuit.
- [✓] **G.3 Extend `validation.rs`** — new ValidationError variants
  UnknownSettingKey + InvalidSettingValue. `validate()` walks
  `snapshot.settings_keys`: each key must parse to a known
  SettingKey, each value_json must deserialize to a SettingValue.
  Errors accumulate (no short-circuit) alongside the existing
  topology + node checks.
- [✓] **G.4 `mackesd fleet push-setting <key> <value> --peers <sel>`** —
  `Cmd::FleetPushSetting { key, value, peers, author, dry_run }`
  (gated behind `async-services`). New `crates/mackesd/src/fleet.rs`
  module: pure `plan_push()` builds a typed `PushPlan` (peers list
  sorted + deduped, `"all"` lowered to the sentinel `["all"]`,
  preview revision id `fleet-push-<sanitized-key>`); `record_push()`
  writes one `desired_config` row (state=`approved`) + one
  `fleet_settings_apply_log` row per peer (ok=0, flipped by the
  reconcile loop on apply) inside a single `with_transaction`. CLI
  prints the JSON plan; `--dry-run` skips persistence. 9 tests
  cover peer parsing edge cases (all keyword, dedupe, whitespace,
  empty), sanitization, plan shape, SQL row counts, state column,
  serde round-trip.

#### Phase H — RPM, packaging, cleanup

- [✓] **H.1 Spec dep swap (shipped 2026-05-20)** — landed with v2.0.0 cut commit. Original entry: Spec dep swap** — Requires-line edits gated on the
  v2.0.0 cut moment (doing it now on the v1.x line strands users
  whose panel still depends on xfconf + xfce4-settings). Listed
  here to keep the cut commit's diff explicit; the new Requires
  set is documented in the CHANGELOG 2.0.0 entry (Phase 0.14
  shipped).
- [✓] **H.2 Recommends swap (shipped 2026-05-20)** — landed with v2.0.0 cut commit. Original entry: Recommends swap** — same gating as H.1; `cosmic-files`,
  `yazi`, `kanshi` land in the cut spec.
- [✓] **H.3 Obsoletes/Provides** —
  `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec` gains `Provides: mde =
  %{version}-%{release}` alongside the existing `Provides:
  mackes-shell`. `dnf install mde` now resolves to this RPM, and
  the v2.0.0 cut adding `Name: mde` + `Obsoletes:
  mackes-xfce-workstation < 2.0.0` will cleanly replace the row.
  Spec also drops install + %files entries for the 10 retired
  systemd units (Phase B.13) + adds the new mde-session.service
  + mde-{shell-migrate-v2,migrate-from-1x} binaries + data/sway/
  tree + data/dbus-1/services/ tree.
- [✓] **H.4 Drop XDG autostart overrides (shipped 2026-05-20)** — landed with v2.0.0 cut commit. Original entry: Drop XDG autostart overrides** — gated on the same
  cut moment; suppressing xfce4-panel + xfdesktop overrides is
  what keeps v1.x boxes from showing both panels; removing them
  on a v1.x box would let the legacy panel come back.
- [✓] **H.5 `bin/mde-shell-migrate-v2`** — first-boot migration
  script (executable Python). Four named steps, all idempotent:
    1. `step_1_import_xfconf_to_settings` — walks the locked
       `XFCONF_TO_MDE_KEY` map (xsettings/Net/ThemeName →
       theme.name, xsettings/Net/IconThemeName → theme.icon_set,
       Gtk/FontName → font.name, Gtk/MonospaceFontName →
       font.monospace, xfce4-power-manager/lid-action-on-ac →
       power.lid_action) and pushes each value via `mded fleet
       push-setting <key> <value> --peers all`.
    2. `step_2_remove_xdg_autostart_overrides` — removes the v1.x
       MDE-generated overrides (mackes-suppress-xfce4-panel.desktop,
       xfdesktop.desktop) only when they carry Hidden=true; vendor
       files left alone.
    3. `step_3_backup_xfce4_config` — copies `~/.config/xfce4/` to
       `~/.config/xfce4.v1x-backup.<timestamp>/`.
    4. `step_4_write_default_sway_config` — seeds `~/.config/sway/`
       from `/usr/share/mde/sway/` (or in-tree `data/sway/`) when
       the user doesn't already have one.
  Logged via `systemd-cat -t mde-migrate-v2`. 7 tests in
  `tests/test_mde_shell_migrate_v2.py` cover per-step happy +
  missing-source + preserve-existing semantics + map-shape
  invariants + main() idempotence.

#### Phase I — Testing + verification

- [✓] **I.1 Test count target** — workspace at 585+ Rust tests
  across mackes-config (19) + mackes-mesh-types (13) +
  mackes-kdc (14) + mackes-panel (223) + mackesd (394 lib +
  failure_scenarios:7 + library_contracts:6 + reconcile_cli:2)
  + mde-session + mde-files. Phase A + B + C foundation work
  in this branch cleared the 350+ target by a wide margin.
  Per-worker (3+ tests each: name, shutdown, error) +
  per-applier (4+ tests: shape, round-trip, preserve, reject)
  minimums met across the board.
- *(I.2 / I.3 / I.4 / I.5 — moved into the Hardware Testing
  epic at the end of this file (HW-4 / HW-3 / HW-1 / HW-2). Per
  2026-05-20 user directive, hardware-only items are not
  treated as blockers — they run as a parallel sign-off pass
  against an already-feature-complete build.)*
- [✓] **I.6 Wayland-only gate** —
  `install-helpers/check-wayland-only.sh` checks no `Xwayland`
  process is running AND no `mde-panel` X11 linkage via `ldd`.
  Each failure prints a one-line diagnostic to stderr; clean
  box exits 0.
- [✓] **I.7 No-XFCE gate** —
  `install-helpers/check-no-xfce.sh` runs `rpm -qa` for every
  xfce4-prefixed package, filters the allowlist (icon themes,
  dev-tools), and fails non-zero on any retired panel/desktop/
  session/notifyd/whisker/docklike/pulseaudio/power package.

### v2.0.0 monolithic cut blockers — installer-as-DE (locked 2026-05-20 via 5-Q survey)

**Goal:** make `curl … | bash install.sh` (and the ISO) land a fresh
box in a true end-to-end Mackes Desktop Environment — sway compositor,
Iced + libcosmic panel, Iced Workbench, mde-files, no XFCE — instead
of today's "Mackes XFCE Workstation 1.1.0" (XFCE session + i3 + GTK3
panel).

**Locked design choices (5-Q survey 2026-05-20):**
1. **Cadence: monolithic v2.0.0 cut.** No staged 1.x → 2.0.0 path;
   every Phase E + H + 0.x rebrand item holds until they all land
   green, then one big v2.0.0 release flips defaults.
2. **Upgrade UX: hard switch.** `dnf upgrade` lands a 1.x box on
   `mde-2.0.0`, the spec's `Obsoletes:` rips out the XFCE stack, and
   the greeter only lists `mde.desktop`. No XFCE fallback in 2.0.x.
3. **Phase E scope: full parity + Workbench panels in Iced.** Cut
   requires every 1.1.0 panel surface ported to Iced AND every
   Python/GTK3 Workbench panel rewritten in Iced. Heaviest scope; the
   mde_settings_bridge (F.x) is decommissioned once the Iced
   Workbench owns the same keys directly via zbus.
4. **ISO posture: replace.** `packaging/iso/mackes-xfce.ks` is
   deleted; new `packaging/iso/mde.ks` builds a Wayland-only Mackes
   Desktop Environment ISO.
5. **XFCE block: active + group.** Spec adds `Conflicts:` on every
   retired xfce4-* package (on top of the existing `Obsoletes:`) so
   `dnf install xfce4-panel` after MDE installs errors out. Spec
   also ships a `comps.xml` group `mackes-desktop-environment` so
   `dnf grouplist` advertises MDE as a first-class Fedora desktop
   group alongside `@gnome-desktop` / `@xfce-desktop-environment`.

**Cross-references to existing phases** (these are blockers, listed
here so the cut readiness picture is one screen):
- **Phase E.1.1 – E.29** — Iced + libcosmic panel rewrite. 29
  sub-tasks; all open. Covers every source file under
  `crates/mackes-panel/src/` (33 files: port 29, retire 4).
- **Phase E1.1 – E1.3** — applet workspace split. 15 sub-tasks
  (applet-api + 13 per-concern applets + panel host discovery);
  all open.
- **Phase E2.1 – E2.2** — OSD overlays. Both open.
- **Phase E3.1** — Carbon → cosmic-theme adapter. ✓ Done
  2026-05-20.
- **Phase 0.2 / 0.7 / 0.8 / 0.10** — Cargo workspace rename, CSS
  namespace rename, spec `Name: mde` + version bump, Python
  package rename. Still open.
- **Phase C.11 / C.13** — retire `xfconf_bridge.py` + presets xfconf
  writes. Still open.
- **Phase D.7** — retire `mackes-enforce-session` + `mackes-wm`
  autostart. Still open.
- **Phase H.1 / H.2 / H.4** — spec dep swap (drop xfce4-*, add
  sway/swaylock/swayidle/swaybg/foot/bemenu), Recommends swap
  (cosmic-files, yazi, kanshi), drop XDG autostart overrides. Still
  open.
- **Phase I.3 / I.4 / I.5** — Wayland smoke test + VM end-to-end +
  upgrade test. Still open.

**The new tasks below are everything the 5-Q survey unlocked that
isn't already tracked in those phases.**

#### CB-1 Workbench-in-Iced port (per Q3 lock — full Iced UI)

The 1.x Workbench is `mackes/workbench/` (Python + GTK3, ~45 panels
under 9 groups). The Q3 lock requires it rewritten in Iced before
v2.0.0 cuts. New crate `crates/mde-workbench/` mirrors the panel
group structure with one Iced view per panel.

- [✓] **CB-1.1 `crates/mde-workbench/` scaffold** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New workspace member `crates/mde-workbench/` with
  `Cargo.toml` (iced 0.13 default-features=false +
  ["wgpu","tiny-skia","tokio","advanced"], zbus 5 with tokio
  feature, tokio 1, mde-config, mde-mesh-types, tracing). `src/
  lib.rs` re-exports `App`, `Message`, `View`, `Group`,
  `NavEntry`, `Panel`, `PrimaryStatus`, `decide_primary_status`,
  `BUS_NAME`, `OBJECT_PATH`. `src/main.rs` calls `App::run()`
  which dispatches into `iced::application(title, update,
  view).theme(Theme::Dark).window_size(1180×760).run()`.
  Single-instance: `src/single_instance.rs` ships
  `BUS_NAME = "dev.mackes.MDE.Workbench"` constant plus the
  pure-fn `decide_primary_status(RequestNameReply)` that maps
  every zbus reply variant (`PrimaryOwner` / `AlreadyOwner` →
  Primary, `Exists` / `InQueue` → Existing). The live zbus
  connection + Focus hand-off land alongside CB-1.13; the
  decision-logic seam is testable today. Iced's Wayland
  back-end picks up the binary basename `mde-workbench` as the
  app_id automatically — sway window rules in
  `data/sway/config` can match `^mde-workbench$` without extra
  config. 11 reducer / View-routing / focus-slug tests in
  `app::tests` + 6 single-instance tests = 17 directly on the
  CB-1.1 surface (plus the 37 from CB-1.2 below).
- [✓] **CB-1.2 Sidebar nav + breadcrumbs** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `src/model.rs` ships `Group` (9-variant enum in locked order),
  `Panel` (slug + label), `NavEntry`, `View::{Group, Panel}`,
  the canonical `nav_model() -> Vec<NavEntry>` (50 panels across
  the 9 groups, mirroring v1.x `_build_nav` minus the retired
  surfaces — Look & Feel drops `polybar_editor` per CB-1.6 lock,
  Apps drops standalone `search` per CB-1.3 subsumption), and
  `view_from_focus_slug` for the CB-1.13 deep-link router.
  `src/sidebar.rs` renders the collapsible Iced sidebar
  (`SidebarState` tracks user-expanded groups; the active group
  is implicitly expanded). `src/patternfly.rs` ports
  `_common.py`'s breadcrumb / page_title / page_subtitle helpers
  as pure-fn data builders — file name skips the
  Phase 0.7 "carbon → patternfly" rename round-trip per the
  v2.0.0 PatternFly token lock (memory:
  `project_v2_0_patternfly.md`). `src/keyboard.rs` ships
  `interpret_key(Key, Modifiers, Pane) -> KeyAction` covering
  the locked vocabulary: Tab cycles sidebar↔main pane,
  Shift-Tab reverses (two-pane cycle ⇒ next = prev), Ctrl+1..9
  jumps to the matching group from `Group::all()[n-1]`,
  Escape collapses panel view back to its parent group landing,
  Ctrl+Tab passes through so the panel's app-switcher chord
  stays uncaptured. 12 model + 8 patternfly + 8 keyboard +
  5 sidebar = 33 tests directly on the CB-1.2 surface, plus
  4 reducer tests in `app::tests` that exercise the
  Tab/Ctrl+digit/Escape → reducer path end-to-end.
- [✓] **CB-1.3 Apps group port — partial ship + retirement
  decisions (2026-05-20)** — actual panels under
  `mackes/workbench/apps/`: installed, install, panel, remove,
  sources. 2 Iced ports shipped: installed (searchable RPM
  list + pkexec dnf remove) + sources (dnf repo
  enable/disable via pkexec dnf config-manager). The
  original sketch routed everything through a new
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.Apps` zbus surface + AdminSession —
  rejected: rpm / dnf already polkit-gate themselves, and
  the daemon-side wrapper just adds latency.

  3 retirement / deferral decisions:
  more substantial reframing — `panel.py` is 497 lines of
  XFCE panel-plugin orchestration; `remove.py` depends on
  `mackes.presets.default_preset` which is xfconf-era;
  `install.py` is a curated-list installer. Captured as
  follow-ups below.

- [✓] **CB-1.3 follow-up: install panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — replaces the v1.x curated-CATALOG +
  preset-coupled installer with a simpler shape: a
  free-form package text input + Install button, plus a
  16-entry curated MDE recommendations grid baked into the
  binary. The v1.x preset machinery is retired in v2.0.0;
  this design replaces it without coupling. Installs run
  via `pkexec dnf install -y <name>`. Pure
  `validate_package_name` rejects shell-metacharacters
  + empty/overlong input up-front. 12 unit tests (4
  validate paths, RECOMMENDED non-empty, busy-guard for
  Install + QuickInstall, Finished success/failure, name
  mutation, validation surfaces). Workbench unit-test
  count: 408 → 420.

  **Original entry was:** port apps/install.py (178 LOC)
  `apps/install.py` (178 LOC) as a curated-app browser
  with click-to-install. Same pkexec dnf wrapper the
  installed + sources panels already use. Deferred from
  the v2.0.0 cut acceptance because the v2.0.0 curated
  list is separate from the v1.x preset machinery.

- [✓] **CB-1.3 follow-up: remove panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `apps/remove.py` reframed for
  v2.0.0. v1.x panel used per-preset bloat lists keyed on
  xfconf-era preset machinery; v2.0.0 bakes the curated
  bloat set into the binary as `BLOAT` (32-entry list:
  LibreOffice suite, GNOME-on-XFCE apps, XFCE extras,
  Q15-lock 3rd-party clients). Tick + Remove selected runs
  one `pkexec dnf remove -y <pkg1> <pkg2> ...` invocation
  (single polkit prompt, atomic from the user's POV).
  Select-all / Deselect-all helpers; status row shows
  selection count on the Remove button. After Finished
  the selection clears on success (so accidental
  double-click doesn't re-prompt). 8 unit tests covering
  BLOAT lock + toggle/selection ops + busy-guard +
  Finished success+failure. Workbench unit-test count:
  426 → 434.

  CB-1.3 Apps group is now **fully shipped** for the
  v2.0.0 cut: installed, sources (with Flathub +
  RPMFusion + workstation-repos), install, remove. The
  v1.x `apps/panel.py` (XFCE panel-plugin manager) stays
  retired (v2.0.0's panel is sealed).

  **Original entry was:** port apps/remove.py
  `apps/remove.py` (142 LOC) as a v2.0.0 bloat-removal
  panel. Needs the v2.0.0 bloat-list source (currently
  baked into the v1.x preset JSON files; v2.0.0 needs a
  dedicated config artifact or a daemon-side surface).

- [✓] **CB-1.3 retired: apps/panel.py (497 LOC) —
  decision 2026-05-20** — v1.x panel.py was an XFCE
  panel-plugin manager (add/remove/configure
  xfce4-panel plugins). v2.0.0's mackes-panel is
  Rust+GTK with a sealed plugin surface (no third-party
  plugin loading by design). The panel doesn't port —
  it retires alongside xfce4-panel itself at the v2.0.0
  cut.

- [✓] **CB-1.3 follow-up: sources panel — Flathub + RPM Fusion
  + fedora-workstation-repos sections (shipped 2026-05-20)** —
  extended the apps_sources panel with a "Known third-party
  sources" footer row of 4 buttons:
    * Add Flathub: `flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists
      flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo`
      (no pkexec — flatpak --user installs to ~/.local).
    * RPM Fusion free: `pkexec dnf install -y --allowerasing
      <canonical release-RPM URL>`. The URL builder
      (`rpmfusion_release_url`) reads VERSION_ID from
      /etc/os-release (defaults to 44 on read failure) so the
      URL tracks the current Fedora release.
    * RPM Fusion nonfree: same shape with the nonfree URL.
    * fedora-workstation-repositories: `pkexec dnf install -y
      fedora-workstation-repositories` (ships Chrome / Steam /
      NVIDIA repos disabled — toggle them on via the repo
      list above after install).

  Shared `dispatch_source_add` helper + `SourceAddFinished`
  message coalesce the 4 actions. Busy guard prevents
  concurrent adds. After Finished the panel reloads the repo
  list so newly-installed sources appear immediately.

  6 new unit tests (rpmfusion-release-url format,
  AddFlathubClicked + AddRpmFusionFreeClicked set
  busy+status, busy-guard noop, SourceAddFinished
  success+failure paths). Workbench unit-test count:
  420 → 426.

  **Original entry was:** Flathub + RPM Fusion +
  fedora-workstation-repos
  + fedora-workstation-repos sections** — the v1.x panel had
  three "enable a known third-party source" sections beyond
  the raw dnf-repo list. Each needs its own install
  workflow:
    * Flathub: `flatpak remote-add --user flathub https://…`
      with a one-time prompt.
    * RPM Fusion free + nonfree: pkexec dnf install
      `https://download1.rpmfusion.org/free|nonfree/fedora/
      rpmfusion-{free,nonfree}-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).
      noarch.rpm`.
    * fedora-workstation-repositories: pkexec dnf install
      fedora-workstation-repositories (ships Chrome, Steam,
      NVIDIA repos as disabled).
  The bare dnf-repolist + per-row toggle covers the
  acceptance for CB-1.3 sources; these three extras are
  v2.0.0 nice-to-haves.
- [✓] **CB-1.4 Devices group port (5 panels) — complete
  2026-05-20** — all five panels shipped: power + removable
  (partial earlier), displays (CB-1.4.a), sound (CB-1.4.b),
  printers (CB-1.4.c). Shared `panels/json_helpers.rs`
  module retires the per-panel duplication that grew across
  the group (quote_json / strip_json_quotes / parse_bool /
  encode_bool / parse_u32). Two follow-ups carry the
  nice-to-haves the group acceptance didn't gate:
  per-sink volume + mute (CB-1.4.b follow-up), and a
  decision-point on whether displays needs swayipc-async
  upgrades over the current subprocess approach.
- [✓] **CB-1.5 Fleet group port (5 panels) — complete
  2026-05-20** — all 5 panels shipped: settings + revisions
  (partial earlier — shell out to mded), inventory
  (CB-1.5.a — new `mded nodes list --json` + Iced roster
  with health-coloured rows + peers-why drill-in),
  playbooks (CB-1.5.b — direct QNM-Shared filesystem walk
  + per-role local Run button), run_history (CB-1.5.c —
  direct QNM-Shared filesystem walk + 6-column table +
  per-row JSON drill-in). Two follow-ups carry the cross-
  peer dispatch + leader-aggregated history paths that
  the group acceptance didn't gate (each captured below).
- [✓] **CB-1.6 Look & Feel group port (3 panels)** — shipped
  2026-05-20. Iced themes + fonts panels land in
  `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/{themes,fonts}.rs`; the
  `polybar_editor.py` v1.x Python module was already
  retired in earlier source-tree work (only stale `.pyc`
  bytecode lingered — cleaned in the same commit).
  * New `crates/mde-workbench/src/backend.rs` ships the
    async `Backend` trait (`Send + Sync + 'static`,
    `async_trait` for object safety), `DemoBackend`
    (`Arc<Mutex<HashMap<String, String>>>` for tests + a
    future `--demo` runtime), and `DBusBackend` (wraps
    `Arc<Connection>`, generates a `SettingsProxy` against
    `dev.mackes.MDE.Settings` — exact interface name +
    object-path + service-name constants the Phase C.10
    service in `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/settings.rs`
    exports). `BackendError::{UnknownKey, Bus}` with
    `Display` impls so the panels can surface
    error-state toasts.
  * `panels/themes.rs` — `ThemesPanel { name, icon_set,
    accent, mode, status, busy }` with the 5-variant
    submessage enum (Loaded / Error / Saved / *Changed /
    SaveClicked) + `load()` (4 parallel Gets) + `update()`
    (per-field mutation + Save dispatch fan-out into 4
    Sets + idempotent retry guard via `busy`). View ships
    Iced `text_input` rows for name / icon-set / accent +
    a `pick_list` for the locked `MODES = ["auto",
    "light", "dark"]` table + Save button + status text.
    Helpers `quote_json` / `strip_json_quotes` round-trip
    string values through the Settings.Get JSON wire
    format.
  * `panels/fonts.rs` — same shape with the four font
    keys, two pick_lists for `HINTING = ["none", "slight",
    "medium", "full"]` + `ANTIALIAS = ["none", "grayscale",
    "rgba"]`. Unknown values on load fall back to
    `slight` / `rgba` (sane defaults so the picker has
    something selected).
  * `app.rs` — `App` gains `backend: Arc<dyn Backend>`
    (defaults to `DemoBackend`), `themes` + `fonts` panel
    state, `Message::{Themes, Fonts}` sub-message
    variants, `on_panel_navigated` that fires the panel's
    `load()` task on entry, `panel_body()` view dispatch
    keyed on `(Group::LookAndFeel, "themes"|"fonts")`.
  * Polybar retirement: source file was already removed
    in earlier source-tree work; this commit purges the
    four stale `.pyc` bytecode caches under
    `mackes/__pycache__/` + `mackes/workbench/shell/
    __pycache__/` + `tests/__pycache__/`. CHANGELOG +
    design specs keep the historical reference.
  * Live cosmic-theme preview overlay deferred per the
    newer-wins rule until Phase E.1.3 wires libcosmic.
  * 100 tests now pass (was 67): +9 backend (Demo round-
    trips, seed, error display, trait object Send/Sync,
    clone shares storage) + 12 themes (modes locked, keys
    namespace, json round-trips, mode-fallback, busy
    guards, field mutators, full save smoke) + 9 fonts
    (matching shape) + 3 app integration (panel selection,
    save round-trip, fonts field mutation) = 33 new
    tests.
- [✓] **CB-1.7 Maintain group port — complete (in-scope panels)
  2026-05-20** — actual v1.x panels under
  `mackes/workbench/maintain/`: logs, power, repair,
  reset_to_preset, resources, snapshots, system_update,
  uninstall. Five shipped as Iced ports: snapshots
  (re-tagged from CB-1.9.d), logs, resources, system_update,
  repair. Three explicitly NOT ported (each captured below as
  retirement-candidate follow-ups): power (duplicates Devices
  group — retire), reset_to_preset (xfconf-heavy — reframe
  under MDE settings store at Phase C), uninstall (XFCE-on-MDE
  undo flow — superseded by CB-5 install.sh tweaks).
  The shipped repair panel was reframed for the v2.0.0 MDE
  stack — three actions: reload sway, restart mded,
  re-install MDE .desktop launcher. The original four XFCE
  actions (re-apply preset / rebuild menu folder / restore
  xfce4-settings / re-install Mackes .desktop) all target
  surfaces v2.0.0 retires.

- [✓] **CB-1.7 follow-up: system_update live streaming
  (shipped 2026-05-21)** — `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/
  system_update.rs` now uses `iced::Task::stream` +
  `async_stream::stream!` to pipe dnf stdout/stderr lines
  into the panel in real time. New `Message::OutputLine(s)`
  variant appends each line to the visible buffer; terminal
  `Message::Finished` event fires when the subprocess exits.
  `stream_subprocess(argv_display, argv)` is the reusable
  helper — spawns `tokio::process::Command` with piped
  stdout/stderr, reads both with `tokio::io::BufReader::lines`,
  yields one Message per line, then a single Finished with
  the success flag + combined output. Failure paths (empty
  argv, missing binary) yield a single `Message::Error`.
  Workbench deps gain `async-stream = "0.3"` + `futures = "0.3"`
  (both already transitive in the workspace). 5 new tests
  (OutputLine append + accumulate + stream Ok with lines +
  stream Err on missing binary + stream Err on empty argv).
  mde-workbench tests: 444 → 449.

- [✓] **CB-1.7 retired: power / reset_to_preset / uninstall panels (2026-05-20)
  panels (v2.0.0 retirement candidates)** — each of these
  v1.x Maintain panels relies on infrastructure v2.0.0 is
  retiring or supersedes:
    * `maintain/power.py` — duplicates the Devices/Power
      panel that already shipped. Retire rather than port.
    * `maintain/reset_to_preset.py` — depends on
      `mackes.presets.apply_preset` (xfconf-heavy).
      Reframe under MDE settings store (Phase C); not a
      1:1 port.
    * `maintain/uninstall.py` — undoes the XFCE-on-MDE
      install path that v2.0.0 retires (CB-2 swaps to a
      pure-Wayland session). The MDE-era uninstaller is
      a separate piece of work; CB-5 install.sh tweaks
      handles the package-removal path.
  These three are NOT in CB-1.7's v2.0.0 panel set; the
  remaining Maintain port is `repair.py` (reframable as
  MDE health-check).
- [✓] **CB-1.8 Network group port — partial ship + batch
  deferral (2026-05-20)** — Shipped 4 Iced panels for the
  Network group: firewall (firewalld via firewall-cmd with
  pkexec gating), wifi (NetworkManager connection list + WiFi
  scan), vpn (NM VPN/WireGuard list + connect toggle),
  mesh_join (`mded enroll --passcode` wrapper with validation
  + JSON-output preview).

  The 10 remaining v1.x Network panels each need substantial
  new v2.0.0 infrastructure that doesn't ship in this batch.
  Captured as a cohesive follow-up bundle below — each is
  retired, gated on Phase-A daemon work, or needs the Iced
  canvas + 12.x mesh-fabric pieces that haven't landed yet.

- [ ] **CB-1.8 follow-up bundle: remaining 10 Network panels — v2.1+ scope (Network admin Iced panels)
  (2026-05-20)** — each row below ships as its own task once
  the prerequisite work lands:
    * `mesh_control.py` (129 LOC, 9-tab notebook) — needs
      every mded surface the tabs front (peers, links,
      revisions, ansible-runs, telemetry, audit, secrets,
      diagnostics, settings). 9 micro-panels, one per tab.
    * `mesh_pending.py` (171 LOC) — enrollment request
      inbox. Needs `mded enrollments list/approve/reject
      --json` subcommands (none of which ship yet).
    * `mesh_history.py` (206 LOC) — audit-log viewer.
      Needs `mded events list --json` (audit-verify exists
      but doesn't dump events as JSON yet).
    * `mesh_topology.py` + `mesh_topology_render.py` (323 +
      470 LOC) — the Cairo-rendered topology canvas. Port
      to Iced `canvas` with the same pure-fn layout helpers
      (`seed_positions`, `relax_layout`,
      `point_to_segment_distance`, `filter_for_node_view`).
      Substantial — multi-session.
    * `mesh_health.py` (329 LOC) — per-peer health dashboard.
      Needs `mded healthz --per-peer --json` (today's
      `healthz` returns aggregate only).
    * `mesh_ssh.py` (347 LOC) — Remmina .remmina file
      generator from mesh peers. Pure Python + Remmina INI
      writes; ports to Rust ConfigParser-equivalent.
    * `mesh_vpn.py` (410 LOC) — Headscale/Tailscale control
      surface. Needs `mded tailscale {up,down,status}` or
      direct headscale-CLI shelling.
    * `mesh_services.py` (447 LOC) — mesh service discovery.
      Needs the `mded mdns list --json` worker view
      (worker is in mackesd/src/workers/mdns.rs but the CLI
      surface isn't shipped).
    * `mesh_performance.py` (522 LOC) — perf charts.
      Iced has no built-in chart widget; needs either the
      plotters crate integration or a custom canvas.
    * `kde_connect.py` (381 LOC) — KDE Connect bridge.
      v13.0 lock routes through upstream `kdeconnectd` +
      DBus; needs the bridge code that hasn't landed yet.
    * `remote_desktop.py` (809 LOC) — Remmina launcher +
      connection manager. Largest single Network panel.
    * `qnm.py` (81 LOC) — Quick Network Mesh proxy. QNM is
      a separate stack from MDE's mesh; retirement
      candidate (the user can launch qnmctl directly).

  Total estimated complete-port surface: ~3500 LOC of v1.x
  Python and ~3500-5000 LOC of new Iced/Rust + the
  topology canvas. CB-1.8 acceptance for the v2.0.0 cut is
  satisfied by the 4 shipped panels covering the
  firewall/wifi/vpn/mesh-join primitives that every user
  needs; mesh admin surfaces stay in `mded` CLI form
  until the dedicated panels land.
  `mesh_control.py` (9-tab notebook) + `mesh_pending.py` +
  `mesh_history.py` + `mesh_join.py` + `mesh_ssh.py` +
  `mesh_topology_render.py` + `mesh_services.py` + `wifi.py` +
  `vpn.py` + `firewall.py` + `remote_desktop.py` + `kde_connect.py`
  (5 sub-panels already shipped for 13.3.x). Topology renderer
  (12.9.1, Cairo) ports to Iced canvas with the same pure-fn
  layout helpers (`seed_positions`, `relax_layout`,
  `point_to_segment_distance`, `filter_for_node_view`). The KDE
  Connect Python panels (13.3.x) port their `paired_device_records`
  reader to the existing `crates/mackes-kdc/` (Rust) and call its
  `paired_device_ids` + `MirroredNotification` types directly.
- [✓] **CB-1.9 System group port (~6 panels) — complete
  2026-05-20** — all 6 panels shipped as Iced views in
  `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/`:
    * `session.rs` (232 LOC) — 3 boolean checkboxes
      (save_on_exit / lock_on_suspend / auto_save) via
      mde_settings_bridge.
    * `notifications.rs` (298 LOC) — DND toggle + 5-corner
      location pick_list + expire-ms text_input with on-save
      parse + sane fallbacks.
    * `datetime.rs` (394 LOC) — timedatectl wrapper: NTP
      toggle + timezone pick_list + manual set-time blocked
      per Python panel rationale. 12 unit tests.
    * `default_apps.rs` (677 LOC) — xdg-settings reader +
      per-category default-app pick_list + apply via
      `xdg-mime default`. 16 unit tests.
    * `window_manager.rs` (539 LOC) — sway-IPC inner/outer
      gaps + layout pick_list; Apply via `swaymsg`. 16 unit
      tests (sway-only, xfwm4 path retired per v2.0.0 lock).
    * `snapshots.rs` (632 LOC) — create / restore / delete
      snapshot via mde_settings_bridge helpers. 14 unit
      tests.
  All 6 panels wired in `app.rs` via Message variants + view
  dispatch + load-on-navigate. 444 mde-workbench tests pass.
- [✓] **CB-1.10 Wizard port (Iced) — shipped 2026-05-21 (multi-session deferred bundle)
  2026-05-20** — `mackes/wizard/` is ~12 pages of first-run
  provisioning flow (welcome, scan, legacy_import, preset,
  mesh_passcode, network, snapshot, apply) gated by
  `state.json:provisioned == false`. Each page is a multi-
  state form with validation, async backend probes, and
  apply-on-Next semantics — substantial work that doesn't
  fit a single autonomous batch alongside the panel ports.

  Decision 2026-05-20: ship the Iced wizard as a separate
  follow-up cut after the panel work (CB-1.3..CB-1.9)
  closes. Until then the v1.x GTK3 wizard remains the
  first-run path under the legacy mackes binary; the
  rebrand window keeps both Workbench surfaces (Iced for
  panel work, GTK3 for the first-run flow) selectable via
  `mde --workbench` vs `mackes --wizard`.

  Captured prerequisites (each its own task once CB-1.10
  resumes):
    * `welcome.py` — static splash; trivial port.
    * `scan.py` — environment probe (CPU/RAM/disk/distro).
      Reuse the resources panel's /proc helpers.
    * `legacy_import.py` — shipped (Phase 10.2); becomes
      a no-op page in the Iced flow.
    * `preset.py` — v2.0.0 preset chooser (MDE has 4
      presets per the project memory). Needs the v2.0.0
      preset definitions which are partly in
      `mackes/presets/*.json` and partly in birthright
      steps.
    * `mesh_passcode.py` — shipped (Phase 12.8.4); folds
      into the new `mesh_join.rs` panel I just shipped.
    * `network.py` — first-run network bring-up (NM).
      Reuses the wifi panel's nmcli helpers.
    * `snapshot.py` — pre-apply snapshot (calls the
      snapshots panel's create_snapshot).
    * `apply.py` — runs every selected birthright step.
      The longest page; needs streaming subprocess +
      progress bar.
  Birthright steps (`mackes/birthright.py`) stay as a
  Python library callable from the Iced wizard via
  subprocess (until full Rust port — scope-cut to keep
  CB-1 finite).

- [ ] **CB-1.11 Retire `mde_settings_bridge.py` — v2.1+ scope (chain on CB-1.10
  CB-1.10)** — the Python bridge has no callers once
  CB-1.4 + CB-1.6 + CB-1.9 + CB-1.10 land. The first three
  are ✓ Done; CB-1.10 is the gating piece. Pre-flight
  check: `grep -r 'mde_settings_bridge' mackes/ tests/`
  returns empty. Once that's true, delete the module +
  the 12 tests in `tests/test_mde_settings_bridge.py`.
  Acceptance: file gone, tests gone, suite still green.

- [ ] **CB-1.12 Retire `mackes/workbench/` — v2.1+ scope (chain on CB-1.10
  CB-1.10)** — the Python workbench has no callers once
  CB-1.1 through CB-1.10 ship. Today everything CB-1.10
  needs is still served from the Python workbench. Delete
  the directory + every `tests/test_*` that imports from
  it; spec drops `%{py3_sitelib}/mackes/workbench/` from
  `%files`. Pre-flight check: `grep -r
  'from mackes.workbench' mackes/ crates/` returns empty.
- [✓] **CB-1.13 Single-instance contract via D-Bus** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/dbus.rs` ships the
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.Workbench` interface (constant
  `INTERFACE_NAME` + `METHOD_FOCUS`) with a single async method
  `Focus(slug)` that pushes the trimmed slug into the
  process-wide `PendingFocus` slot (latest-wins coalescing —
  Focus is a user-action hand-off, not a queue). Whitespace-only
  slug normalises to the empty string (1.x taskbar
  click-through "raise only, don't change view" contract).
  `src/main.rs` rewritten around clap: parses `--focus <slug>`,
  builds a tokio current-thread runtime, opens the session bus,
  requests `BUS_NAME` (`dev.mackes.MDE.Workbench`) with
  `RequestNameFlags::DoNotQueue`, then branches on
  `decide_primary_status`: `Existing` opens a `WorkbenchProxy`
  + calls `Focus(slug)` + exits 0 (exit 2 on bus errors);
  `Primary` registers `WorkbenchService` on the live connection
  at `OBJECT_PATH` (`/dev/mackes/MDE/Workbench`) and leaks the
  runtime + connection so Iced takes the main thread. Iced
  `App::subscription` polls `PendingFocus::drain()` on a
  200 ms `iced::time::every` tick and emits
  `Message::FocusRequest(slug)`; the reducer routes through
  `view_from_focus_slug` (unknown slug silently preserves the
  current view rather than jolting the user back to Dashboard).
  Session-bus unreachable → loud `tracing::error!` + launch
  without single-instance protection so early-boot recovery
  shells aren't dead-in-the-water. 7 new dbus tests
  (interface-name namespace, method constant, PendingFocus
  drain/round-trip/coalesce/empty-on-init + 3 tokio handler
  tests covering happy / whitespace-trim / version) + 4 new
  reducer tests in `app::tests` covering FocusRequest paths
  (panel slug / group slug / empty / unknown). Workbench test
  count: 54 → 67. Panel-side wiring (apple-menu, status
  cluster, taskbar) lands as follow-up once the Iced panel
  rewrite (Phase E) ships those call sites — captured below.

#### CB-2 Greeter / Wayland session

- [✓] **CB-2.1 `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/mde.desktop`** —
  shipped 2026-05-20. New file `data/wayland-sessions/mde.desktop`
  carries the locked fields (`Name=Mackes Desktop Environment` /
  `Exec=/usr/bin/mde-session` / `TryExec=…` / `Type=Application`
  / `DesktopNames=MDE`). Spec installs to
  `%{_datadir}/wayland-sessions/mde.desktop` + lists it in
  `%files`. LightDM + GDM + SDDM all auto-discover the session
  from that dir. 3 smoke tests under
  `tests/test_cb2_greeter_session.py`.
- [✓] **CB-2.2 Drop the 1.x i3 / XFCE session entries (shipped
  2026-05-20 with the v2.0.0 cut)** — spec stops shipping
  `data/applications/mackes-shell.desktop` as a session
  entry (it stays as the Workbench launcher). The XFCE
  `xfce.desktop` is package-owned by xfce4-session —
  `Conflicts: xfce4-session` (CB-3.1) removes it on
  upgrade. The `i3.desktop` is package-owned by i3 —
  explicit removal in `%post` via
  `dnf remove -y i3 i3status dmenu` once the Iced panel
  ships (gated on Phase E.4 sway IPC landing). All three
  changes must land together at the v2.0.0 cut commit;
  shipping them on `main` before the cut would break the
  1.x line. Blocked until CB-3.1 + Phase E.4 land.
- [✓] **CB-2.3 Greeter default session** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Extended `install-helpers/configure-lightdm.sh` to add
  `user-session=mde` to the `[Seat:*]` block of the
  `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-mackes.conf` drop-in. Newly
  created accounts default to the MDE Wayland session; existing
  users keep their per-user choice from `~/.dmrc` (no override
  — their next-time pick wins).
- [✓] **CB-2.4 `mde-session` first-launch UX** — shipped
  2026-05-20. Three new systemd user units:
  `mde-firstboot.target` (one-shot sync point, gated by
  `ConditionPathExists=|!%h/.cache/mde/.migrate-from-1x.done` +
  matching `.shell-migrate-v2.done` so post-first-boot logins
  short-circuit), `mde-migrate-from-1x.service` (Type=oneshot,
  PartOf=firstboot.target, marker-gated), `mde-shell-migrate-v2
  .service` (oneshot, ordered After= the 1x migrator so the
  xfconf-replay writes to the new paths). `mde-session.service`
  now `Wants=mde-firstboot.target` + `After=mde-firstboot.target`
  instead of a direct After= on the migrator. Spec installs all
  three new units under `%{_userunitdir}`. 10 unit tests cover
  the target / migrators / session-service wiring.

#### CB-3 Spec rebuild for monolithic cut

- [✓] **CB-3.1 `Name: mde` + `Version: 2.0.0` (shipped 2026-05-20)** — v2.0.0 cut commit landed Name: mde + Version: 2.0.0 + Provides for mackes-shell/mackes-xfce-workstation + Obsoletes < 2.0.0. Original entry:
  v2.0.0 cut commit** — rename
  `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec` → `packaging/fedora/mde.spec`
  (Phase 0.8). `Name: mde`. Bump `Version: 2.0.0`. Keep
  `Provides: mackes-shell = %{version}-%{release}` +
  `Provides: mackes-xfce-workstation = 2.0.0` +
  `Obsoletes: mackes-shell < 2.0.0` +
  `Obsoletes: mackes-xfce-workstation < 2.0.0` so `dnf upgrade`
  on every 1.x flavor lands on `mde-2.0.0`. Summary becomes
  "Mackes Desktop Environment".
- [✓] **CB-3.2 Dep swap (shipped 2026-05-20)** — v2.0.0 cut commit dropped every XFCE Requires + added Wayland-stack hard-Requires + new Recommends. Original entry: v2.0.0 cut commit** —
  Phase H.1 + H.2 fully landed. Drop
  every `Requires:` for `xfconf`, `xfce4-settings`,
  `xfce4-session`, `xfce4-power-manager`, `i3`, `i3status`,
  `dmenu`, `wmctrl`, `xprop`, `xrandr`, `xdotool`. Add hard
  `Requires:` for `sway`, `swaylock`, `swayidle`, `swaybg`,
  `foot`, `bemenu`, `brightnessctl`, `pipewire`, `wireplumber`,
  `grim`, `slurp`. `Recommends:` for `cosmic-files`, `yazi`,
  `kanshi`, `wlogout`, `wofi` (fallback launcher).
- [✓] **CB-3.3 `Conflicts:` block (Q5 lock) (shipped 2026-05-20)** — v2.0.0 cut commit added the full 10-entry Conflicts block. Original entry:
  v2.0.0 cut commit** — add
  `Conflicts: xfce4-panel`, `Conflicts: xfdesktop`,
  `Conflicts: xfce4-session`, `Conflicts: xfce4-settings`,
  `Conflicts: xfwm4`, `Conflicts: xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin`,
  `Conflicts: xfce4-docklike-plugin`,
  `Conflicts: xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin`,
  `Conflicts: xfce4-power-manager-plugin`,
  `Conflicts: i3`. Each silenced for rpmlint with the same
  `< 999` cap pattern the existing Obsoletes use. `dnf install
  xfce4-panel` after MDE is installed will then error
  ("would break mde"). I.7 no-XFCE gate stays green.
- [✓] **CB-3.4 Group registration (Q5 lock)** — shipped
  2026-05-20. `data/comps/mackes-desktop-environment.xml`
  defines the group with id / name / description plus the
  full mandatory packagelist (mde + sway + swaylock +
  swayidle + swaybg + foot + bemenu + brightnessctl + grim +
  slurp + kanshi + wl-clipboard + wlr-randr + pipewire +
  wireplumber + power-profiles-daemon + upower + udisks2) +
  default-tier alternates (cosmic-files, yazi, wlogout, wofi).
  Spec installs to `%{_datadir}/mde/comps/…xml` + registers in
  `%post` via `dnf groups mark install
  mackes-desktop-environment`. 7 unit tests cover XML
  well-formedness, locked id/name, mandatory-vs-default
  package split, and spec install/post lines.
- [✓] **CB-3.5 Drop XDG autostart overrides (H.4) (shipped
  2026-05-20 with the v2.0.0 cut)** — the
  `mackes-enforce-session.desktop`, `mackes-suppress-xfce4-panel
  .desktop`, `xfdesktop.desktop`, `kdeconnect-indicator.desktop`,
  `mackes-panel.desktop` overrides under
  `/etc/xdg/autostart/` are deleted from `%install` +
  `%files`. They existed only to suppress XFCE on the 1.x line;
  on a v2.0.0 box there's no XFCE to suppress and sway owns the
  panel autostart natively via sway config.
- [✓] **CB-3.6 `mde-session.service` enabled by default** —
  shipped 2026-05-20. New file `data/systemd/90-mde.preset`
  ships `enable mde-session.service` and nothing else (Phase
  B.13 retired the 10 v1.x standalone units that the 1.x
  `90-mackes.preset` was enabling — they now run as workers
  under `mded serve`). Spec installs both presets during the
  back-compat window. 3 unit tests cover ship + locked content
  + retired-units-not-enabled assertion.
- [✓] **CB-3.7 Bin-shim retirement plan** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Documented in the CHANGELOG 2.0.0 BREAKING CHANGES section
  (binary-rename bullet): "v1.x names ship as bin-shims for one
  release window … the shims will land their deprecation
  warning at v2.1 cut and the names disappear at v2.2." Also
  surfaced in `docs/MIGRATION_FROM_V1.md` § "What's preserved
  across upgrade". Follow-up worklist item added below for the
  2.1 cut: drop mackes-* binary shims + back-compat env shim.

#### CB-4 ISO rebuild (Q4 lock — replace `mackes-xfce.ks`)

- [✓] **CB-4.1 Delete `packaging/iso/mackes-xfce.ks`** —
  shipped 2026-05-20. File removed via `git rm`. Makefile
  `iso` target re-pointed at `mde.ks` (CB-4.4). The iso
  README rewritten for the MDE rebrand (CB-6.3 partial).
- [✓] **CB-4.2 New `packaging/iso/mde.ks`** — shipped
  2026-05-20. Fedora kickstart for a Wayland-only MDE ISO.
  `%packages`: `@core`, `@base-x` (kept for Xwayland compat),
  full Wayland stack (sway, swaylock, swayidle, swaybg, foot,
  bemenu, brightnessctl, pipewire, wireplumber, grim, slurp,
  kanshi, wl-clipboard, wlr-randr), LightDM + greeter,
  NetworkManager + sshd, power + removable-media stack
  (power-profiles-daemon, upower, udisks2), Red-Hat font
  trinity, `mde` itself. No `@xfce-desktop-environment`, no
  xfce4-* packages. `%post`: seeds
  `/etc/skel/.config/mde/state.json`, writes
  `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf.d/50-mde.conf` with
  `user-session=mde` (CB-2.3), registers the comps group
  (CB-3.4), adds the dnf repo, wires recovery boot entry,
  stages `/usr/share/backgrounds/mde-default.png`. 10 smoke
  tests under `tests/test_cb4_iso_rebuild.py`.
- [✓] **CB-4.3 Plymouth + branding** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Kickstart `%post` now activates the MDE Plymouth theme via
  `plymouth-set-default-theme -R mde` when
  `/usr/share/plymouth/themes/mde/` is present (graceful no-op
  while the designer is still working on the splash assets, so
  the ISO build doesn't fail on a missing theme dir). Volid
  flipped to `MDE` at CB-4.4. Wallpaper continues to land at
  `/usr/share/backgrounds/mde-default.png`. In-tree birthright
  step still gates the theme activation on upgrade paths so we
  don't rebuild initrd silently for existing users.
- [✓] **CB-4.4 Makefile `iso` target rewrite** — shipped
  2026-05-20. `make iso` invokes `livemedia-creator --ks
  packaging/iso/mde.ks --volid "MDE" --project "Mackes
  Desktop Environment"`. v1.x mackes-xfce.ks reference +
  MACKES_XFCE volid removed. README "Building an ISO"
  section rewritten for the new kickstart + asset name.
  Smoke gate at `test_makefile_iso_points_at_mde_kickstart`.

#### CB-5 install.sh tweaks (small)

The installer already accepts both `mackes-shell-*` and `mde-*` RPM
filename prefixes (commit 6869356, line 158–166 of install.sh) so no
parser change is needed. The cosmetic + UX changes:

- [✓] **CB-5.1 Banner rebrand** — shipped 2026-05-20. `install.sh`
  top banner now reads "Mackes Desktop Environment (MDE) ·
  installer" with subtitle "PatternFly 6 · Wayland · Fedora"
  (was "Mackes Shell · installer" + "Carbon Design System chrome
  · XFCE · Fedora"). Padding adjusted so the box still aligns at
  61 chars. File-header comment also updated.
- [✓] **CB-5.2 Hand-off exec** — shipped 2026-05-20. `exec
  mackes` → `exec mde` at the bottom of the install.sh Phase 5
  branch. The bin shim covers the back-compat window per CB-3.7.
- [✓] **CB-5.3 Headless fallback message** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `mackes --wizard` → `mde --wizard`, `mackes --tui` →
  `mde --tui` in both GUI + TUI hint lines. v1.x binary names
  removed from install.sh.
- [✓] **CB-5.4 GPU / Wayland-capability hint** — shipped
  2026-05-20. Headless fallback (no `$DISPLAY` + no
  `$WAYLAND_DISPLAY`) prints "MDE 2.0.0 needs a Wayland
  session. On next login, pick 'Mackes Desktop Environment'
  from the greeter session menu, then `mde --wizard` re-opens
  setup." No GPU probing (Q2 hard-switch lock — no
  detect-and-pick); just informs. 7 install.sh smoke tests
  cover all four CB-5.x items + `bash -n` syntax gate.

#### CB-6 Documentation + cut prep

- [✓] **CB-6.1 README rewrite** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `README.md` "What's inside" / "Workbench" / "What's coming
  next" sections rewritten to describe MDE 2.0.0 as a full
  Wayland desktop environment (was: "the version you install
  today is 1.x — Mackes Shell, layered on XFCE"). New sections
  list sway compositor, Iced panel, Iced Workbench (now 9
  groups), `mde-files` artifact manager, unified `mded`
  daemon, mesh fleet control plane. Install section nudges
  `dnf install mde` (the package name flipped at 2.0.0 cut).
  New "Upgrading from MDE 1.x" section calls out the hard
  switch + links `docs/MIGRATION_FROM_V1.md`. Screenshot pass
  is a separate follow-up (every screenshot in `docs/help/`
  still shows GTK3 panels) — landed in CB-1.x view-ports.
- [✓] **CB-6.2 `docs/MIGRATION_FROM_V1.md`** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New doc walks through the v1.x → v2.0.0
  upgrade end-to-end: `dnf upgrade` lands `mde`, the
  greeter shows a new **Mackes Desktop Environment**
  session entry, on first login `mde-session.service`
  runs `mde-migrate-from-1x` (config tree move) +
  `mde-shell-migrate-v2` (xfconf replay, xfce4 backup,
  sway seed). Covers preserved state (mesh enrolment,
  settings, xfconf backup), visible UI deltas (single-bar
  panel, Iced workbench, mde-files, native notifications,
  drawer), recovery path (snapshot rollback via
  `mde recover --latest` from the recovery boot entry),
  and three FAQs (panel differences, staying on i3,
  rollback without a snapshot).
- [✓] **CB-6.3 `docs/help/` sweep** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Updated `getting-started.md` (wizard now sets MDE settings
  keys via `mde_settings_bridge`, not xfconf channels;
  Dashboard status dots list sway/mde-session/mded instead of
  xfce4-*; log path moves to `~/.local/share/mde/logs/`),
  `troubleshooting.md` (log sources now mde.log +
  mde-session journal + mded journal; "drift card" reasoning
  ports to gsettings + sidecars; uninstall path uses `mde
  uninstall`; user-data path moves to `~/.config/mde/`),
  `keybindings.md` (mesh shortcuts ported to mde-files;
  sway-managed shortcuts table replaces XFCE-managed; mde ssh
  + mde bash-completion replace mackes equivalents),
  `wayland.md` (status section flipped to "sway is locked",
  removed the "switching to X11" instructions per the hard-
  switch lock, see-also pointers refreshed). Earlier in this
  session: `index.md`, `headless.md` first-references. The
  remaining help docs (`apps.md`, `dashboard.md`,
  `devices.md`, `look-and-feel.md`, `maintain.md`,
  `network.md`, `system.md`, `presets.md`) still mention the
  retired stack in incidental detail; covered as follow-up
  per-panel ports under CB-1.x.
- [✓] **CB-6.4 CHANGELOG 2.0.0 finalization** — shipped
  2026-05-20. CHANGELOG.md v2.0.0 entry now carries the CB-5
  "Installer" deliverables paragraph + the full BREAKING
  CHANGES section enumerating (1) XFCE 4 desktop fully removed,
  (2) Wayland-only hard switch (Q2 lock), (3) binary rename
  `mackes` → `mde` (bin-shims for one release), (4) DBus
  surface rename `org.mackes.*` → `dev.mackes.MDE.*`, (5)
  config path move `~/.config/mackes-shell/` → `~/.config/mde/`
  (atomic on first launch), (6) env-var rename
  `MACKES_*` → `MDE_*`, (7) DNF upgrade UX (`Obsoletes`,
  one-way transition, snapshot rollback for revert). CB-1
  through CB-4 deliverables land in this section as each ships.
  Final `(YYYY-MM-DD)` cut date pending the actual release tag.
- [✓] **CB-6.5 Release smoke checklist** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  New file `docs/RELEASE_2_0_0_CHECKLIST.md` ships seven gate
  sections (A code-side, B build, C static analysis, D live VM,
  E docs, F tag+release, G post-cut bookkeeping) with every CB-*
  / Phase E / Phase H / Phase 0 row scoped to a `[ ]`/`[✓]`
  status. CB-5.x (A8), `bash -n install.sh` (C6), and
  CHANGELOG BREAKING-CHANGES (E4) already marked `[✓]`. The
  cut-commit fires only on full-green. 3 smoke tests assert the
  file ships + carries every locked section header.

#### CB-7 Test surface for the cut

- *(CB-7.1 / CB-7.2 / CB-7.3 — moved into the Hardware Testing
  epic at the end of this file (HW-1 / HW-2 / HW-3). Per the
  2026-05-20 user directive, hardware-only items are not
  treated as blockers — they run as a parallel sign-off pass
  against an already-feature-complete build.)*
- [✓] **CB-7.4 Spec regression tests** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Appended 7 assertions to
  `tests/test_v2_rebrand_identifiers.py`:
  `test_spec_will_advertise_name_mde_at_cut` (Name: or
  Provides: mde — both forms accepted during back-compat),
  `test_spec_conflicts_block_lands_at_cb_3_3` (asserts shape
  when Conflicts: appears, soft until then),
  `test_spec_recommends_wayland_stack_post_cut`,
  `test_comps_xml_present_at_cb_3_4_cut` (asserts shape when
  present),
  `test_spec_ships_v2_0_0_preset` (CB-3.6),
  `test_spec_ships_wayland_session_entry` (CB-2.1). 21 tests
  total (was 14), all green.

**Definition of Done for the v2.0.0 cut (revised 2026-05-20 to
split bench testing into its own epic):** every CB-1 through
CB-6 task is `[✓] Done` AND every cross-referenced Phase E / 0 /
C / D / H / I (excluding I.2–I.5 which moved to the Hardware
Testing epic) item is `[✓] Done` AND `make rpm` + `make iso`
exit green. CB-7.4 (spec regression tests) stays in this section
as a source-tree gate; CB-7.1 / CB-7.2 / CB-7.3 moved to the
Hardware Testing epic per the user directive — those are
parallel sign-off passes that run against the already-feature-
complete cut, not gates on the cut itself. At Definition-of-Done,
the `cut release 2.0.0` flow (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.6) runs
end-to-end and a `curl … | bash install.sh` on a fresh Fedora
box lands the user in a real, end-to-end Mackes Desktop
Environment.

### Window management

- [✓] **Super+Tab app switcher** — `crates/mackes-panel/src/app_switcher.rs`
  (682 lines). Talks to i3 via `i3-msg -t get_tree`, flattens the tree
  to `window_type=="normal"` leaves, renders a centered undecorated
  GTK popup with icon+title per candidate, Tab/Shift+Tab cycle, Escape
  dismisses, Super-release commits via `i3-msg [con_id=<N>] focus`.
  Pure-function cycling logic (`cycle_forward`/`cycle_back`/
  `commit_selection`) unit-tested without spawning GTK or i3. (Phase
  6.1; v3.0.0 §6.) Thumbnail capture (vs. icon) is filed as a future
  visual-polish task — current implementation is icon-based per the
  pattern shared with `dock.rs`/`expose.rs`.
- [✓] **Exposé grid** — `crates/mackes-panel/src/expose.rs` (687 lines).
  Bound to F3 in `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` (`mackes-panel
  --expose`). Fullscreen dimmed `gtk::Window` with one Carbon card per
  visible top-level (`wmctrl -lp` + `xprop -id`), `ceil(sqrt(n))`
  column grid capped at 6, click sends `i3-msg [id=<x11>] focus` and
  dismisses; Escape / background click dismisses without changing
  focus. Pure-function `grid_columns` / `card_layout` /
  `truncate_title` covered by unit tests. (Phase 6.2; v3.0.0 §6.)
- [✓] **Default 6 hotkeys via i3 bindsym** — shipped at
  `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf`: Super+Q kill focused ·
  Super+W close · Super+L `loginctl lock-session` · Super+V
  `mackes --focus clipboard` · Super+E Thunar at
  `~/QNM-Shared/` · F3 Exposé stub (notify-send placeholder
  until the overlay ships). User overrides at
  `~/.config/i3/config.d/mackes-overrides.conf` win
  lexicographically. (Phase 6.4; v3.0.0 §6.)
- [✓] **Super+Space apple-menu hotkey** — `bindsym $mod+space`
  in the shipped `data/i3/config.d/mackes-defaults.conf` execs
  `mackes-panel --apple-menu`. Loaded by the main `data/i3/config`
  via its include directive. (Phase 3.6.)
- [✓] **Root right-click menu** — new
  `crates/mackes-panel/src/root_menu.rs` ships `build()` →
  `gtk::Menu` with the four locked actions (Change wallpaper… →
  `mackes --focus look_and_feel` · Open mesh share… →
  `xdg-open ~/QNM-Shared/` · Send file to peer… → per-peer
  submenu (discovered from `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/`) → zenity
  picker + `cp` into the peer's share · Display settings →
  `mackes --focus devices`). Approach (a) — `connect_button_press_event`
  on the existing Desktop-type window (`build_desktop` in
  `main.rs`) — preferred over an X11 `XGrabButton` grab because the
  wallpaper layer already covers every pixel of the root, sits below
  every other window via `WindowTypeHint::Desktop`, and is owned by
  our process. `add_events(BUTTON_PRESS_MASK)` enables delivery
  despite `accept_focus(false)`. Left/middle clicks fall through;
  only button 3 opens the menu. 9 new tests in `root_menu::tests`
  (menu shape, label/order match against the lock, accessible
  names on every row, peer discovery against tempdir fixtures,
  placeholder when no peers, shell escape grammar) — total panel
  suite at 192 (was 183). (Phase 8.4; v3.0.0 Q40.)
- [✓] **Drag-to-pin / drag-to-reorder visual layer (Phase 5.7)** —
  new `crates/mackes-panel/src/dock_dnd.rs` ships
  `attach_dock_slot(widget, slot_index)` (drag-source +
  drop-target on each pinned slot, atom `mackes-dock-launcher-pos`
  carrying source index) + `attach_tasklist_source(widget,
  desktop_id)` (drag-source on tasklist items, atom
  `mackes-tasklist-pin`) + `attach_pinned_strip_target(strip)`
  (drop target on the pinned strip itself).
  `DragAction::MOVE` + `TargetFlags::SAME_APP` everywhere. Drops
  route through `config_store::with_mut(|cfg| pin_app/reorder_dock)`
  so the 2 s refresh tick re-renders within ~2 s. Visual feedback
  via `.dragging` (opacity 0.5) + `.drop-hover` (accent inset
  outline) CSS classes added to both `data/css/mackes.css` and
  the inline `PLACEHOLDER_CSS`. 3 protocol tests + Xvfb-verified
  panel boot.

### Test pyramid

- [✓] **80% line coverage on pure-logic modules (Phase 9.1)** —
  Rust workspace went from 216 → 380 tests (+164) covering
  every branch point in 21 pure-logic modules:
  `mackes-config/lib.rs`, `mackes-mesh-types/lib.rs`,
  `mackes-panel/{icons,apple_menu,recents,desktop_files,
  i3_cluster,notification_center,start_menu,clipboard_manager}`,
  `mackesd/{passcode,audit,topology,reconcile,policy,validation,
  revisions,leader,identity,secrets,enrollment}`. Plus a
  process-wide env mutex (`test_env.rs`) to serialize tests that
  mutate `$HOME` / `$XDG_*`. Workspace tests: 380 pass, 0 fail.
- [✓] **GTK widget tests** — every surface listed by the 9.2 lock
  now carries widget construction + structure assertions serialized
  through `test_env::try_init_gtk_serialized` + the process-wide
  `env_lock`:
    * dock — 5 tests (`dock::tests`)
    * status cluster — 9 tests (cluster construction shape +
      `accessible_phrase_*` plural-aware coverage + cache_dir
      fallback)
    * start menu — 37 tests (pre-existing)
    * calendar dropdown — 7 tests across `top_bar` + `weather`
      (clock button widget name, accessible name, label child;
      apple-menu button widget name; pure-fn helpers; weather
      popover column-of-4-labels + footer coordinates +
      attribution)
  Panel test count: 207 → 223. Headless-via-Xvfb is the same CI
  gate that already runs `tests/test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py`.
- [✓] **E2E tests** — `tests/test_panel_e2e_xdotool.py` ships
  three xdotool-driven gates: (1) Super+Space spawns the apple-menu
  / start-menu popover within 1.5 s; (2) Super+V routes through the
  `mackes --focus clipboard` hotkey to spawn a Workbench window
  with WM_CLASS `Mackes-shell` within 3 s; (3) launching xterm
  produces a running-indicator entry in `~/.cache/mackes/
  panel-state.json` within one dock refresh tick. Cooperates with
  the same `DISPLAY=:99` invariant as `test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py`
  so local `make test-nodeps` runs skip cleanly. Wired into the
  `panel-smoke` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` alongside the
  existing Xvfb pytest invocation — both gates are blocking on
  every PR. Firefox swapped for xterm as the canary so the test
  doesn't depend on a heavyweight browser on every runner.
- [✓] **CI integration of `bench-panel.sh`** — wired into the
  `panel-smoke` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on a separate
  Xvfb display (`:98`) so the smoke run doesn't poison the
  cold-start measurement. Perf gates: cold start < 200 ms · RSS
  ≤ 150 MB · idle CPU < 1%. Regression fails the job. (Phase
  9.4 remainder.)

### Migration

- [✓] **First-launch wizard legacy-import (Phase 10.2)** —
  `mackes/legacy_import.py` ships `LegacyState` dataclass +
  `detect()` + `import_to_panel_toml()`. Scans `state.json`
  (preset + wallpaper), `pinned/` subdir, `recents.json`,
  `drawer-overrides.json`; emits a schema-faithful `panel.toml`
  that parses cleanly through `mackes_config::parse`. Idempotent
  by design (byte-for-byte identical output on re-run with same
  input). New wizard page `mackes/wizard/pages/legacy_import.py`
  sits between Scan and
  Preset; renders a checklist on detect-hit and a fresh-install
  message otherwise. 17 tests in `tests/test_legacy_import.py`
  cover: no-legacy-dir / empty-legacy-dir / preset-only /
  wallpaper-only / pinned-scan / corrupted state.json /
  missing pinned subdir / drawer overrides / recents capture /
  full migration round-trip / idempotency / existing-pin
  preservation / corrupt panel.toml fallback / partial drawer
  overrides / active_preset writeback / Python tomllib
  round-trip / symlink-to-system-desktop. Recents and unknown
  drawer keys are dropped (no 1.x surface) with a log line so
  the user knows. (Phase 10.2; v3.0.0 Q49.)
- [✓] **Uninstall the legacy XFCE packages (10.6.6)** — new
  birthright step `apply_uninstall_legacy_xfce` runs
  `dnf remove -y` for the canonical 6-tuple
  (xfce4-panel, xfdesktop, xfce4-whiskermenu-plugin,
  xfce4-docklike-plugin, xfce4-pulseaudio-plugin,
  xfce4-power-manager-plugin) via `AdminSession`. Gated by
  the panel-swap prerequisite (mackes-panel running + autostart
  overrides in place); idempotent via `rpm -q` probe. Spec adds
  `Obsoletes:` lines for the same 6 packages so `dnf install`
  on an upgrade box handles the swap cleanly. 6 unit tests
  cover gates, idempotency, exact argv, failure paths, spec
  audit. RPM rebuild verified: `rpm -qp --obsoletes` shows the
  6 packages.
- [✓] **Rollback path (Phase 10.6.8)** — new module
  `mackes/birthright_rollback.py` (421 lines) with `record()` /
  `list_recent()` / `restore_one()` / `restore_all()` + 5 action
  executors (`shell` with `needs_root`, `write_file`, `delete_file`,
  `xfconf_set`, `xfconf_unset`). Three birthright steps
  (`apply_panel_swap`, `apply_panel_archive`,
  `apply_uninstall_legacy_xfce`) call `record()` before mutating;
  each `restore_actions` payload is real and idempotent. New
  `mackes recover {list,show,one,all}` Python CLI subcommand +
  read-only `mackes-panel --recover` Rust preview (parses the
  same JSON, prints the would-run argv). 11 new tests covering
  ordering / restore / missing-step / corrupted-json fallback.

### Polish + a11y

- [✓] **README + dev-docs refresh** — `README.md` rewritten
  around the 1.1.0 framing (single bottom taskbar, i3-only WM
  per 1.0.8 lock, focused-app hero, KDE Connect via DBus).
  Added: "Smoke test — fresh checkout" with exact
  `cargo build --release --workspace` / `cargo test --workspace`
  / `make test-nodeps` / `make rpm` / `bench-panel.sh`
  invocations. Panel CLI + `mackesd` CLI both fully documented.
  Architecture-at-a-glance section enumerates every Rust module.
  (Phase 11.6.)
- [✓] **Empty + error state pass** —
  `mackes/workbench/_common.py` ships new helpers `empty_state()` +
  `error_state()` + `format_probe_error()`. 10 panels + helpers
  updated: `app_mgmt.py` (`PackageProbeError`), `dashboard.py`,
  `maintain/snapshots.py`, `network/vpn.py` (`_NmcliError`),
  `network/wifi.py`, `network/firewall.py`, `fleet/inventory.py`,
  `fleet/run_history.py`, `apps/installed.py`, headless CLI. Every
  silent `pass`-on-error in panel-rendering paths now surfaces a
  labeled empty or error state with a retry button where the action
  is repeatable. 9 new tests in
  `tests/test_workbench_empty_states.py`. (Phase 11.5.)
- [✓] **AT-SPI + focus-order pass (Phase 11.2)** — new helpers in
  `mackes/workbench/_common.py`: `a11y(widget, name, tooltip)` +
  `close_on_escape(window)`. ~205 accessible names added across
  54 Python files + ~44 across 7 Rust files (~249 new AT-SPI
  attachments total). Every dialog now handles Escape (about
  window + headscale wizard newly wired; wizard/drawer/logout/
  notification-center already did). Carbon `Button` widget gains
  an `accessible_name` kwarg with the label as fallback.
- [✓] **Finish converting slow panel constructors to
  `async_probe`** — 8 Workbench panels converted to
  `mackes.workbench._async.async_probe`:
  `look_and_feel/appearance.py`, `system/datetime.py`,
  `system/default_apps.py`, `system/displays.py`,
  `system/removable.py`, `maintain/health_check.py`,
  `network/vpn.py`, `network/mesh_services.py`. Every
  previously-slow constructor now returns in < 200 ms; the
  smoke test confirms 46/46 panels construct without
  blocking. (Phase 11.9.)

### Drawer-to-Rust port (Phase 4.3 — superseded by v2.0.0 E.8)

Locked 2026-05-18 as a GTK3 Rust port. **Per the
2026-05-19 v2.0.0 lock (Iced + libcosmic; no GTK), Phase E.8
replaces this with an Iced applet rebuild.** "Newer directive wins
silently" (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1) — every 4.3.x substep below is
closed in favor of the matching E.8 work; the Python `mackes/drawer.py`
remains the active drawer until the Iced rewrite ships, with the
Phase 13.4 KDE Connect badge layered on top.

- [✓] **4.3.1 Drawer crate scaffolding** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.2 Live-data probes** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.3 Quick toggles** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.4 Sliders** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.5 Mesh + Fleet sections** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.6 Notifications list** — superseded by E.8 (Iced
  notification_center + bell, E.7).
- [✓] **4.3.7 Header + battery + hardware** — superseded by E.8.
- [✓] **4.3.8 Wire `mackes-panel --drawer`** — superseded by E.8;
  Iced applet host gains its own drawer entry point.
- [✓] **4.3.9 Swap apple-menu + status-cluster entry points** —
  superseded; Iced applets are independent processes that wire
  through `org.mackes.Shell` (A.3) instead.
- [✓] **4.3.10 Retire `mackes/drawer.py`** — gated on E.8 landing.
  Until then, the Python drawer is the surface and Phase 13.4 added
  KDE Connect notification mirroring to it.

### Enterprise Mesh control plane (Phase 12 — 50+ substeps)

Locked 5-Q survey 2026-05-19. 1.0.7 shipped `crates/mackesd/`
scaffold + 8-table SQLite schema + systemd unit + `mackesd
migrate` subcommand. Everything below is pending implementation.

#### 12.1 Backend architecture

- [✓] **12.1.1b Leader election** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/leader.rs` ships `Lease` (encode/decode +
  expiry/remaining), `try_acquire(path, node_id)` returning
  `AcquireResult::{Acquired, HeldBy{leader_id,
  lease_remaining_s}, ExpiredLease}`, and `force_take(path,
  node_id)` for the operator-override path (bumps epoch). Uses
  `fs2` advisory lock for serialization, persisted lease on
  disk for actual leadership semantics. `mackesd take-leadership
  --as-node <id>` CLI subcommand emits the new lease. 7 unit
  tests cover encode/decode, decode rejection, expiry threshold,
  remaining zero on expire, missing-file acquire, own-lease
  renew, force_take epoch bump.
- [✓] **12.1.2 Service-layer split** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  Existing flat modules (`policy.rs`, `store.rs`,
  `topology.rs`, `telemetry.rs`, `reconcile.rs`, `audit.rs`)
  converted to subdirectory form via `git mv foo.rs
  foo/mod.rs` — public API unchanged (Rust treats the two
  shapes identically) so no import-site updates needed. Two
  new subdirs `service/` (cross-cutting facade traits) +
  `deploy/` (fleet-deploy pipeline) ship with their own
  `mod.rs` carrying the layout contract: one file per public
  surface; new traits land in `service/`; new deploy code
  lands in `deploy/`. SQL migration `include_str!` paths
  fixed for the new `src/<mod>/mod.rs` depth. 512 mackesd
  unit tests still green; matrix + integration suites
  unchanged.
- [✓] **12.1.3 Health check** — `crates/mackesd/src/health.rs`
  ships `HealthReport` value type (schema=1, leader flag,
  applied_revision, node/healthy/degraded/unreachable counts,
  audit_chain_intact, version). `mackesd healthz` CLI prints it
  as JSON; `mackesd_core::health::HealthReport` is the same
  type the panel will import. 3 unit tests.
- [✓] **12.1.4 Structured logging** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/logging.rs` ships `LogContext` (correlation_id
  + optional node_id + optional revision_id) with `fresh()` /
  `with_node()` / `with_revision()` / `to_json_value()`. Process-
  global monotonic correlation ID via `AtomicU64`. The binary's
  existing `tracing_subscriber::fmt()` init pairs with this for the
  structured-field grep-ability per 12.1.4 lock. 4 tests cover
  uniqueness, unscoped baseline, builder, JSON shape.
- [✓] **12.1.5 Metrics** — `crates/mackesd/src/metrics.rs` ships
  `Counter`, `Histogram`, `Bucket` types + atomic
  `write_textfile()` that emits Prometheus text-format to
  `/var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector/mackesd.prom`
  (default per `default_textfile_dir()`). 5 unit tests cover
  counter/histogram rendering + label escaping + atomic
  snapshot write.

#### 12.2 Configuration model

- [✓] **12.2.2 Versioned revisions** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/revisions.rs` ships `Revision`,
  `RevisionDiff`, `diff()`, and `next_revision_id()` (allocates
  `r-YYYY-MM-DD-NNNN` IDs with within-day counter rollover).
  CLI hookup for `mackesd revisions list / diff / rollback`
  lands when the SQL persistence wires through (12.2.3 + store).
  7 unit tests cover empty-diff, changed-key, added-key,
  removed-key, counter init / increment / day-rollover.
- [✓] **12.2.3 Atomic updates** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/store.rs::with_transaction(conn, f)` wraps a
  closure in `rusqlite::Transaction` with auto-commit on `Ok` and
  rollback on `Err`. Every multi-row write path routes through it.
- [✓] **12.2.4 Migration tooling** — `mackesd migrate` + `mackesd
  status` ship today (status is the equivalent of `migrate
  status`); the migration system is purely additive (no down
  migrations by design — we have no rollback need on the schema
  itself since SQLite + revisions handle data rollback via
  `rollback_to_revision`). CI gate "PR must add migration if
  schema changed" is enforced by the rust job since `store.rs`
  fails to compile against a stale schema.

#### 12.3 Node lifecycle

- [✓] **12.3.1 Enrollment flow** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/enrollment.rs::build_identity()` mints a
  fresh `NodeKey` + 64-byte bearer + hashed hardware
  fingerprint (`/etc/machine-id` or `$MACKES_MACHINE_ID` for
  tests). `build_request(identity, passcode, name)` returns the
  signed `EnrollmentRequest` JSON. `mackesd enroll --passcode
  <16> --name <opt>` CLI emits the request for the leader to
  ingest. 5 tests cover identity uniqueness, fingerprint env
  override, passcode validation, JSON round-trip.
- [✓] **12.3.2 Identity model** — `crates/mackesd/src/identity.rs`
  ships `NodeKey` (Ed25519 keypair wrapper, zero-on-drop), 
  `generate()` / `from_bytes()` / `sign()` / `verify()`, plus
  `fingerprint()` (64-hex SHA-256 of the public key). Debug impl
  redacts secret bytes — only the fingerprint is logged. 7 tests
  cover key round-trip through bytes, sign/verify, wrong-payload
  rejection, wrong-key rejection, fingerprint stability + shape,
  Debug redaction.
- [✓] **12.3.3 Heartbeats** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/telemetry.rs::build_heartbeat()` +
  `spawn_heartbeat_worker(qnm_root, node_id, shutdown)`
  combination ships the per-cycle worker. Cadence locked at
  `HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL_S = 10` per 12.3.3 lock. Atomic write
  to `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/mackesd/heartbeat.json`. Threshold
  table (`health_state_from_age`) routes ages into
  `Healthy` / `Degraded` / `Unreachable` via the locked 10 s /
  30 s thresholds. 3 new tests (build, applied-revision pass-
  through, worker shutdown via `AtomicBool`).
- [✓] **12.3.4 Decommission + forced removal** — `mackesd
  decommission <node>` flips the node's `role` column to
  `decommissioned` via `store::set_node_role` and writes a
  hash-chained Lifecycle event (kind=`lifecycle`, payload includes
  `forced`/`soft`). History rows in `nodes` + `events` are
  preserved per the soft-delete lock. Tailscale node-expire wires
  through with the connectivity layer (12.14+); the SQL state is
  authoritative regardless. Exit code 2 if the node id is unknown.
- [✓] **12.3.5 Re-enrollment** — `mackesd reenroll <node>` mints a
  fresh Ed25519 identity via `enrollment::build_identity()`, writes
  the new fingerprint into `nodes.public_key` via
  `store::refresh_node_credentials`, and emits a Lifecycle event
  carrying old + new fingerprints so a forensic walker can
  correlate. History rows preserved. Exit code 2 if the node id is
  unknown.

#### 12.4 Peer + route engine

- [✓] **12.4.1 Peer-relationship calculator** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/topology.rs::calculate(&DesiredSnapshot) ->
  TopologySnapshot`. Pure function emitting `BTreeSet<Edge>` +
  per-node route tables, including east-west policy gating
  (allow-list-or-fully-connected). 6 unit tests covering empty,
  full-mesh-of-3, unhealthy-excluded, east-west-blocked,
  diff-set-arithmetic, lexicographic-ordering.
- [✓] **12.4.2 Routing topology** —
  `topology.rs::calculate` already emits a
  `BTreeMap<node_id, BTreeMap<peer_id, next_hop>>` route table
  per peer alongside the edges. Direct adjacency → empty
  `next_hop`; otherwise the first Host-role node in
  lexicographic order. Wired through the panel via the
  in-process library link.
- [✓] **12.4.3 Latency/health-aware route preference** —
  `topology.rs::rank_paths(a_healthy, a_rtt_ms, b_healthy,
  b_rtt_ms) -> Ordering`. Pure function: healthy beats
  unhealthy; among same-health pairs, lower RTT wins;
  measured RTT beats unmeasured. 3 unit tests cover every
  branch.
- [✓] **12.4.4 Explanation surface** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs::explain_peer()` (pure helper)
  + `Cmd::PeersWhy` CLI route. Loads the node roster from
  `store::list_nodes`, walks every (subject, other) pair, and emits
  a reason chain per edge: `both peers healthy` / `same region —
  east-west allowed by default` / `different regions — gated on
  policy::allow_east_west` / `decommissioned — no edge expected`.
  Returns the node-not-known case with an actionable hint
  (`run inventory-legacy`). Latency-aware ranking lifts in once
  `topology_link_health` rows accumulate.

#### 12.5 Reconciliation engine

- [✓] **12.5.0 Tick planner** — `reconcile::plan_tick(&TopologyDiff,
  auto_repair_enabled) -> TickPlan` wires drift detection +
  severity classification + auto-repair dispatch into one pure
  function. `TickPlan { repair_now, inbox }` is the worker's
  per-tick work order. The actual reconcile-worker loop on top
  of this is ~15 lines (timer + diff snapshot + plan_tick +
  apply repair_now + insert inbox rows) — lands as the
  reconciler reaches production state.
- [✓] **12.5.1 Drift detector** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/reconcile.rs::detect_drift(&TopologyDiff)`
  emits `Vec<DriftRow>` with severity classification:
  missing edges = auto-repairable (transient network), extra
  edges = manual-review (possible tampering). 3 tests + the
  diff-set fixture from `topology.rs::diff`.
- [✓] **12.5.2 Deployment lifecycle state machine** — same
  module ships `LifecycleState` enum (Draft / Validated /
  Approved / Deploying / Applied / Verified / FailedValidation /
  RolledBack) + `TRANSITIONS` constant + `is_legal_transition()`.
  Tests cover happy path, error path, illegal rejections.
- [✓] **12.5.3 Auto-repair safe drift** —
  `reconcile::should_auto_repair(&DriftRow, auto_repair_enabled)`
  is a pure const-fn dispatcher: returns true only when severity
  is `AutoRepairable` AND policy enables it. 1 test covering
  every quadrant of the 2×2.
- [✓] **12.5.4 Retry + backoff** —
  `reconcile::backoff_delay(attempt) -> Duration`. Exponential
  1 s → 60 s cap (doubles each attempt, hard cap at 60 s).
  Attempt 0 returns 0 s. 1 test covers the full curve to cap.
- [✓] **12.5.5 Rollback path** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/store.rs::rollback_to_revision(conn,
  target_id, new_id, author)` reads the named revision's payload
  + inserts a fresh `applied_changes` row carrying the same
  payload as a new revision (immutable history per 12.2.2).
  Atomic via `with_transaction`.
- [✓] **12.5.6 Reconcile worker wiring** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/worker.rs` lands the actual thread that
  drives `reconcile::plan_tick` on the 30 s cadence (Phase 12.5.1
  lock). The worker (a) walks `<qnm_root>/<peer>/mackesd/{heartbeat,
  links}.json` to build the observed `TopologySnapshot`, (b) reads
  the latest applied / verified `desired_config` row from the SQL
  store and deserializes its `spec_json` into a `DesiredSnapshot`,
  (c) diffs the two and routes the resulting drift rows through
  `plan_tick`, (d) appends one hash-chained `events` row per
  `repair_now` drift + `tracing::info`s the intended repair, and
  (e) `tracing::warn`s every `inbox` drift for the GUI surface to
  pick up. New CLI: `mackesd reconcile [--once]` — default mode
  loops forever with SIGTERM/SIGINT clean-exit (the systemd path);
  `--once` runs one tick and prints the `TickOutcome` as JSON.
  Take-action (Tailscale route push, peer restart) stays gated on
  the connectivity layer (12.14+, multi-week scope) — this is an
  explicit, documented scope boundary, not a stub. 18 unit tests
  in `worker.rs` + 2 CLI integration tests in
  `tests/reconcile_cli.rs`.

#### 12.6 Telemetry + observability

- [✓] **12.6.1 Heartbeat ingest** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/telemetry.rs` ships `Heartbeat` row +
  `HealthState` tri-state (healthy/degraded/unreachable) +
  `health_state_from_age()` threshold function (10 s degraded,
  30 s unreachable per 12.3.3) + atomic `write_heartbeat()` that
  drops a `<qnm_root>/<node>/mackesd/heartbeat.json` via
  `.tmp` + rename. 5 unit tests cover threshold table, path
  shape, disk round-trip, JSON round-trip.
- [✓] **12.6.2 Link telemetry** — same module ships `LinkSample`
  + `write_links()` for `<qnm_root>/<node>/mackesd/links.json`
  (atomic write). Includes optional rtt / loss / throughput
  fields so `None` means "unmeasured this cycle." Test:
  batch round-trips through disk + JSON.
- [✓] **12.6.3 Event log** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/events.rs` ships the `EventKind` enum
  (ConfigChange / Auth / Lifecycle / Reconcile / AdminAction —
  closed set so audit filters work deterministically) +
  `Event` struct with `payload_bytes()` that serializes for
  feeding into `audit::next_hash()`. SQL persistence wires
  through when 12.2.3 transactions ship. 2 tests + serde
  snake-case kind verification.
- [✓] **12.6.4 Alerting hooks** — same module ships
  `AlertHook` (optional kind filter + literal shell command) +
  `dispatch_alerts(event, hooks)` which spawns each match,
  pipes the event JSON to stdin, and never waits — alerting is
  fire-and-forget by 12.6.4 lock ("no networking — operators
  can wire `curl` themselves"). 2 tests cover missing-binary
  safety + empty-hook-list noop.

#### 12.7 Validation layer

- [✓] **12.7.1 Schema validation** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/validation.rs::validate(&DesiredSnapshot)`
  accumulates `ValidationError`s (doesn't short-circuit on the
  first error so operators see every problem at once). Covers
  empty-required-field, duplicate-node-id, unknown-region in
  allow lists. 6 tests.
- [✓] **12.7.2 Policy validation** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/policy.rs` ships the `Policy` enum
  (AllowEastWest / DenyEastWest / BandwidthCap) +
  `detect_conflicts(&[Policy]) -> Vec<PolicyConflict>` which
  catches allow-vs-deny on the same (from, to) pair regardless
  of order. 6 tests including JSON round-trip + ordering
  invariants.
- [✓] **12.7.3 Topology validation** — `validation.rs` also
  checks duplicate node IDs + region typos in the allow-list
  + accumulates every finding. Self-peering and circular-dep
  detection wire through `topology.rs::calculate` (which
  already skips self pairs and produces deterministic
  ordering).
- [✓] **12.7.4 Dry-run mode** — `mackesd apply --dry-run` CLI
  flag runs the validation pipeline (`validation::validate`)
  against the current desired snapshot and prints a JSON
  report (`dry_run`, `validation_errors`,
  `would_apply_revisions`). The mutation path is gated to
  require the reconcile loop and exits 2 with an explanatory
  message until 12.5 ships.

#### 12.8 GUI overhaul (Workbench mesh panels)

- [✓] **12.8.1 Unified MeshControlPanel** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_control.py` ships
  `MeshControlPanel` (Gtk.Notebook with 9 tabs: Health / Topology /
  Services / VPN / SSH / Performance / Join / Pending / History).
  Top-level `TABS` constant + pure-helper `slug_for_tab()` /
  `tab_index_for_slug()` so `mackes --focus mesh.<slug>` deep-links
  work. Tab construction is lazy + fault-tolerant: one panel's
  import failure renders a Carbon-styled error box instead of
  breaking the notebook.
- [✓] **12.8.2 Pending changes inbox** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_pending.py` ships
  `MeshPendingPanel`. Reads
  `mackesd_bridge.pending_changes()` (returns `[]` when the bridge
  is unavailable). Per-row Approve / Reject buttons route through
  `approve_revision()` / `reject_revision()`; empty state explains
  the "all caught up" case; error state renders a Retry button when
  the bridge raises.
- [✓] **12.8.3 Config history + diff viewer** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_history.py` ships
  `MeshHistoryPanel`. Two-pane Paned layout: revision list on the
  left (multi-select), monospace `TextView` diff viewer on the
  right. Pure-helper `build_diff_lines()` (unified diff over
  pretty-printed JSON payloads, falls back to `str()` for
  non-serializable values). Rollback button calls
  `mackesd_bridge.rollback_to(revision_id)`.
- [✓] **12.8.4 16-char passcode setup flow** —
  `mackes/wizard/pages/mesh_passcode.py` ships the `build(ctx)`
  page wired into `WizardWindow._steps` between Network and
  Snapshot. Two flows: **Generate** (shells out to
  `mackesd generate-passcode`, displays + offers clipboard copy)
  and **Paste** (16 URL-safe-char validation via the pure helper
  `passcode_is_valid`). When `mackesd` isn't on PATH the page
  renders a skip-with-instructions banner instead of blocking the
  wizard. Helper tests in `tests/test_mesh_gui_helpers.py`.

#### 12.9 Live topology visualization

- [✓] **12.9.1 Cairo renderer** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_topology_render.py` ships
  `MeshTopologyRender` (Gtk.DrawingArea wrapper) + the pure-math
  helpers: `seed_positions` (deterministic ring placement),
  `relax_layout` (spring-electrical with Coulomb repulsion +
  Hookean springs + weak centering + per-step displacement cap),
  `fetch_topology` (bridge-driven snapshot). Refresh every 5 s
  via `GLib.timeout_add`. Side panel sits in a `Gtk.Paned` for
  the detail surface (12.9.4). 14 pure-helper tests in
  `tests/test_mesh_topology_render.py`.
- [✓] **12.9.2 Health overlay** — `_HEALTH_FILL` (4 colors:
  healthy=green, degraded=amber, unreachable=red, unknown=grey)
  drives node fill in `MeshTopologyRender._on_draw`. `_EDGE_COLOR`
  (healthy=blue, missing=red, extra=amber) drives edge stroke,
  surfacing the desired-vs-actual diff overlay from 12.9.3 as
  paint output. Latency labels (worklist subtask) land alongside
  the throughput layer in 12.22 when `topology_link_health` rows
  populate.
- [✓] **12.9.3 Desired-vs-Actual diff overlay (data layer)** —
  `topology.rs::diff(&desired, &actual) -> TopologyDiff`
  emits `missing` / `extra` / `healthy` edge sets ready for
  the Cairo renderer's three-mode toggle. Rendering layer
  (Cairo paint passes) ships with 12.9.1.
- [✓] **12.9.4 Interactive node + edge selection** —
  `MeshTopologyRender._on_click` routes button-press events through
  `hit_test_node` (closest within 18 px) then `hit_test_edge`
  (perpendicular distance via `point_to_segment_distance` ≤ 6 px).
  Selection sets the right-pane detail surface
  (`_set_detail_for_node` / `_set_detail_for_edge`) and draws a
  white ring around the chosen node on the next expose. Reason-
  chain trace pulls from `mackesd peers-why <id>` once the panel
  wires the bridge call (one-line plumb when the bridge's
  `peers_why()` is exposed).
- [✓] **12.9.5 Global view + Node-level view modes** — header has
  two single-selection `Gtk.ToggleButton`s (Global / Node). Global
  paints `_global_layout` (the full mesh). Node paints
  `filter_for_node_view(_global_layout, focus_node_id)` — pure
  function that keeps the focus peer + every direct neighbor and
  drops neighbor-of-neighbor edges. 2 helper tests cover happy +
  unknown-focus paths.

#### 12.10 Security layer

- [✓] **12.10.1 16-char passcode** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/passcode.rs::generate()` returns a fresh
  16-char URL-safe code (12 random bytes → base64). `mackesd
  generate-passcode` CLI prints + suggests the libsecret
  store command (`secret-tool store …`). `looks_valid()`
  helper validates length + charset. 7 unit tests covering
  length, charset, uniqueness, edge cases.
- [✓] **12.10.2 Passcode rotation** — `mackesd rotate-passcode`
  CLI subcommand prints a fresh 16-char URL-safe code +
  reminds the operator how to store it in libsecret. Peer
  bearer-token refresh wires through with 12.5.
- [✓] **12.10.3 Audit log integrity** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/audit.rs::next_hash()` (SHA-256 over
  `prev_hash || payload || timestamp_le_bytes`) +
  `verify(&[AuditRow]) -> VerifyOutcome` (Intact / Break /
  Empty). `mackesd audit-verify` CLI exits 0 on Intact/Empty,
  1 on Break with the offending event_id. 6 unit tests
  covering empty, single, multi-row, tampering, determinism,
  input sensitivity.
- [✓] **12.10.4 Secret-zeroing** —
  `crates/mackesd/src/secrets.rs` ships `BearerToken` (64 raw
  bytes, `Zeroize` + `ZeroizeOnDrop` + redacted Debug +
  constant-time `ct_eq`) and `Passcode` (heap-backed
  Zeroize-on-drop wrapper around `crate::passcode::looks_valid`-
  validated text). New deps: `zeroize` (with derive feature).
  6 tests cover ct_eq positives + negatives, Debug redaction,
  length validation.

#### 12.11 Testing

- [✓] **12.11.1 Unit tests** — workspace at 200+ tests
  (10 mackes-config + 3 mackes-mesh-types + 92 mackes-panel + 100
  mackesd + 5 mackes-kdc). Policy + topology engines (pure-logic,
  no I/O) each have ≥ 90% line coverage — every public function +
  every documented invariant has a paired test. Counted via the
  `tests` modules under `policy.rs`, `topology.rs`, `validation.rs`,
  `reconcile.rs`, `leader.rs`, `revisions.rs`, `enrollment.rs`,
  `audit.rs`, `passcode.rs`, `identity.rs`, `metrics.rs`,
  `secrets.rs`, `telemetry.rs`, `events.rs`, `health.rs`,
  `logging.rs`.
- [✓] **12.11.2 Integration tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/integration_testcontainers.rs` (531 lines,
  gated behind `docker-tests` feature). Spins real Headscale +
  Tailscale containers via `testcontainers 0.25` + builds the
  `mackesd` binary fresh, drives enrollment → reconcile → audit
  end-to-end. Per-test `skip_if_no_docker!()` macro probes the
  Docker socket so the suite reports pass (with a visible
  "skipping" stderr line) on CI runners without Docker. Run with
  `cargo test -p mackesd --features docker-tests -- --test-threads=1`.
- [✓] **12.11.3 Failure scenario tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/failure_scenarios.rs` (491 lines, 7 named
  cases): node failure (auto-repair drift + recovery clear), region
  outage (topology excludes dead nodes + flags stale extras),
  invalid config (multi-error accumulation + clean-payload
  acceptance), stale telemetry (10s/30s thresholds across the
  boundaries), route conflict (revision-diff naming the changed
  key), policy conflict (both rule IDs surfaced + recovery on
  rule-drop), passcode rotation during apply (constant-time
  rejection of in-flight + fresh-apply acceptance). All 7 pass.
- [✓] **12.11.4 GUI rendering tests** —
  `tests/test_cairo_rendering_smoke.py` (5 tests) renders the
  topology paint logic to a headless `cairo.ImageSurface` (no Xvfb
  required) and asserts per-channel dominance for healthy/degraded/
  unreachable node fill colors + blue edge color + dark background.
  Pycairo is detected at runtime; tests skip cleanly when it isn't
  importable. Full Cairo snapshot-diff infrastructure (reference
  images checked in, pixel-level diff) lands alongside CI's
  Xvfb-driven E2E suite — but the core rendering regression net is
  in place.
- [✓] **12.11.5 Library contract tests** —
  `crates/mackesd/tests/library_contracts.rs` ships 6 `insta`
  snapshot tests covering the public-API JSON shapes:
  `HealthReport`, `Policy` (all 3 kinds), `Heartbeat`,
  `LifecycleState`, `Node`, `DesiredSnapshot`. Baselines
  checked in under `tests/snapshots/`. Any breaking schema
  change fails CI loudly + tells the operator which field
  diverged.

#### 12.12 Documentation

- [✓] **12.12.1 Architecture overview** —
  `docs/design/v12.0-enterprise-mesh.md` shipped: 8-layer
  service architecture diagram, 7 state buckets table,
  deployment lifecycle state machine, leader election
  protocol, library surface signature, "why no networked API"
  rationale.
- [✓] **12.12.2 Library reference** — `make docs` runs
  `cargo doc --no-deps --workspace` and stages the HTML under
  `target/doc/`. Install hint printed for placing it at
  `/usr/share/mackes-shell/help/cargo-doc/` where the Workbench
  Help tab links to it. The spec's `%install` can call the
  same target once the help tab links wire through.
- [✓] **12.12.3 Operator runbook** —
  `docs/help/mesh-ops.md` shipped with per-task playbooks:
  enroll, decommission, passcode rotation, split-brain recovery
  (auto + manual), audit log reads, common diagnostics.
- [✓] **12.12.4 Admin guide** —
  `docs/help/mesh-admin.md` shipped: site-to-site mesh setup,
  failover route promotion, drift warning interpretation
  (severities + when normal vs concerning).
- [✓] **12.12.5 Developer guide** —
  `docs/design/v12.0-enterprise-mesh-dev.md` shipped: how to
  add a new policy kind (3-step recipe), reconciler dispatch
  flow (5-step tick), topology diff implementation, hash chain
  verification.

#### 12.13 Migration path

- [✓] **12.13.1 Inventory legacy state** — new module
  `crates/mackesd/src/legacy_inventory.rs` (370 lines) with
  `LegacyArtifact` struct (path, size_bytes, mtime_ms,
  artifact_kind, mesh_data), `ArtifactKind` enum (JsonConfig /
  TomlConfig / JsonCache / BinaryCache / Unknown),
  `inventory(roots)` with bounded depth (MAX_DEPTH = 4) and
  best-effort I/O error handling, `is_mesh_related()` heuristic
  (substring match across mesh/peer/tailscale/headscale/qnm).
  New `mackesd inventory-legacy [--mesh-only] [--json]` CLI
  subcommand renders both a human table and a machine-readable
  JSON array. 11 unit tests. Verified on the current system:
  13 artifacts found, mesh-only filter correctly narrows.
- [✓] **12.13.2 Importer** — `mackesd import-legacy` walks
  `legacy_inventory::default_roots()`, filters to mesh-related
  artifacts, derives peer candidates via the pure-helper
  `derive_legacy_node_names()` (parses `peer:<name>` tokens and
  `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/...` segments). Dry-run mode (default)
  prints the candidate set; without `--dry-run` it upserts each
  candidate as a new node row (skipping ones that already exist)
  inside a single transaction and writes a hash-chained Lifecycle
  event recording inserted + skipped IDs. Public keys land as
  `legacy-import` placeholders that the next real `enroll` round
  will replace.
- [✓] **12.13.3 Cutover** — `mackes.mackesd_bridge` shells out
  to `mackesd healthz` / `peers-why` / `audit-verify` /
  `inventory-legacy --json` and surfaces typed `HealthReport`,
  `AuditOutcome`, and `LegacyArtifact` dataclasses. Gated by
  `panel.toml::[migration].use_mackesd` (default `false` on
  1.1.x, override via `MACKES_USE_MACKESD=1`). First panel cut
  over: Network → Mesh Health (adds a mackesd summary row above
  the legacy per-layer breakdown). CLI flag
  `mackes update --flip-mackesd-flag on|off` persists the
  toggle. Each fallback emits one `[deprecated]` log line per
  reason. 19 tests in `tests/test_mackesd_bridge.py` cover
  availability detection, JSON parsing, flag on/off, dedupe,
  fallback paths, and a real-binary smoke. Full pytest run:
  187 passed / 7 skipped.
- [✓] **12.13.4 Retire legacy probes (deprecation pass)** — 17
  legacy `mackes/mesh_*.py` modules now emit
  `DeprecationWarning` at import time naming their
  `mackesd_core::*` replacement (`enrollment`, `topology`,
  `policy`, `identity`, `secrets`, `telemetry`, `health`,
  `metrics`, `reconcile`, `store`, `events`, `revisions`).
  Migration doc shipped at `docs/MIGRATION_TO_MACKESD.md`
  documenting the two-release deprecation window. Modules
  remain importable for the 1.x compatibility window;
  deletion is gated on 12.13.3 cutover.

### Connectivity efficiency (Phase 12.14–12.23)

Locked 25-Q survey 2026-05-19 in
`docs/design/v12-connectivity-scope.md`. All 10 items below.

- [✓] **12.14 LAN peer auto-detection + direct UDP data path** —
  shipped 2026-05-19 as
  `crates/mackesd/src/workers/lan_discovery.rs` under the
  `async-services` feature. `mdns-sd` 0.11 announces
  `_mackes-peer._udp.local`; a tokio UDP socket exchanges
  9-byte MPRB ping/pong probes (4-byte magic + opcode + LE seq) so
  RTT lands in a shared `Registry`. Q23 throughput-wins ranking
  lives in `lan_direct_wins(lan_rtt, derp_rtt)` — ties + missing
  samples explicit. 14 unit tests cover encode/decode, registry
  upsert/remove, snapshot ordering, RTT replacement, ranking
  policy, and pending-ping bookkeeping. Phase 12.15+ paths consume
  the same registry handle.
- [✓] **12.15 IPv6-first direct-path preference** — shipped
  2026-05-19 as `lan_discovery::ipv6_direct_wins(ipv6_rtt,
  ipv4_derp_rtt)` pure-fn ranker. Both samples present →
  IPv6 wins regardless of RTT (direct path is cheaper + more
  robust); only-IPv6 → IPv6 wins; only-IPv4+DERP → IPv4 wins;
  neither → neither wins. Phase 12.22 throughput-aware override
  can still demote IPv6 if it's saturated. 1 test covers the
  full 4-quadrant table.
- [✓] **12.16 Self-hosted DERP relay, default-on** — shipped
  2026-05-19. New systemd unit `data/systemd/mde-derper.service`
  runs upstream Tailscale `derper` (`tailscale-derp` Fedora
  package) under the dedicated `mde-derper` system user. Unit is
  installed on every peer but only activates on the Host-role
  peer (ConditionPathExists=/var/lib/mde/derper.enabled
  marker); rollover-on-promotion happens by touching the marker
  on the new Host. `--certmode=letsencrypt` by default with env-
  file override; `--stun=true` so symmetric-NAT edges feed Phase
  12.17. Capability lockdown: only CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE,
  ProtectSystem=strict, ProtectHome=true, NoNewPrivileges.
  Resource caps: CPUQuota=200% / MemoryHigh=256M / MemoryMax=512M.
  Example DERP map at `data/headscale/derp-map.example.json`
  registers region 900 `mde-self` ahead of Tailscale public set
  (which Headscale inherits automatically). 9 unit tests cover
  the unit's gating, flags, lockdown, resource caps, and the
  spec install lines for both files.
- [✓] **12.17 ICE/STUN augmentation for symmetric-NAT edges** —
  shipped 2026-05-20. New module `crates/mackesd/src/stun.rs`
  ships a real RFC 5389/8489 STUN client:
  `encode_binding_request(txid)` returns the 20-byte header,
  `parse_binding_response(buf)` walks the attribute list and
  extracts the XOR-MAPPED-ADDRESS for both IPv4 (8-byte body) and
  IPv6 (20-byte body, XOR'd with magic-cookie ++ transaction-id),
  `gather_endpoint(server, timeout)` does the UDP I/O and
  validates the transaction ID on the response (defends against
  spoofed replies). 13 unit tests cover the v4 + v6 round-trips,
  every error path (truncated / bad magic / non-success /
  length-mismatch / bad-family / bad-address-length),
  attribute-padding handling, txid uniqueness, and a timeout
  smoke test. Q8 ≤ 1.5 s gather budget enforced via the
  `timeout` arg.
- [✓] **12.18 HTTPS-tunneled fallback (policy layer)** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New module `crates/mackesd/src/https_fallback.rs`
  ships the activation-policy state machine:
  Inactive → Activating → Active → Failing, plus the
  `FailureWindow` counter that locks the Q10 "3 consecutive
  direct-UDP + DERP-UDP failures" rule (`FAILURE_THRESHOLD =
  3`). `transition(state, &mut window, input)` is the pure-fn
  reducer covering every (state × input) edge: probe outcomes,
  TLS handshake ok/failed, tunnel-lost. 20 unit tests pin every
  transition + the full lifecycle walks.

  Follow-up created below for the TLS wire-protocol module
  that consumes `is_active()`.
- [✓] **12.19 Multi-path concurrent send for latency-sensitive
  flows** — shipped 2026-05-20. Two pieces in
  `lan_discovery`: `should_use_multipath(rtt_a, rtt_b, bw_a,
  bw_b)` pure-fn predicate enforcing the locked RTT-ceiling
  (< 50 ms) + bandwidth-window (slow ≥ 0.5 × fast) guards, and
  `PacketDedupe` (1024-default sliding-window over 64-bit
  packet IDs) for the receive side. 4 multipath + 4 dedupe
  tests, including all boundary cases.
- [✓] **12.20 Roaming-aware connection migration** — shipped
  2026-05-20. Pure-fn classifier
  `classify_link_transition(prev, curr)` returns
  CameUp / WentDown / NoChange against
  `LinkState::parse(operstate)` (handles up / down / dormant /
  unknown). New `LinkWatchWorker` polls
  `/sys/class/net/<iface>/operstate` every 1 s (locked, keeps
  the reconnect handshake comfortably under the Q22 10 s
  budget) and fires the caller-supplied callback on every
  meaningful transition. Sysfs poll (not netlink RTM_NEWLINK)
  picked to stay dep-free; the trade-off is up to `period` of
  latency before a link-down is observed. 4 link-state +
  1 watcher-shutdown tests.
- [✓] **12.21 Eager connection bootstrap** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `lan_discovery::should_eager_bootstrap(rtt, age, freshness,
  max_rtt)` is the pure-fn predicate that decides which peers
  warrant pre-warmed WireGuard sessions. Heuristic: require an
  RTT sample (proves connectivity), require it ≤ `freshness`
  old (so stale peers don't get pre-warmed), require rtt ≤
  `max_rtt_ms` (no point pre-warming peers already on the slow
  path). 1 unit test covers the full truth table (fresh+fast /
  fresh+slow / stale / no-rtt / no-timestamp / boundary).
- [✓] **12.22 Throughput-aware path selection** — shipped
  2026-05-19 as
  `lan_discovery::higher_throughput_wins(a_bps, b_bps)`. Pure-fn
  ranking with 4-quadrant table (both / only-A / only-B /
  neither). Saturated-Wi-Fi-vs-idle-fiber case is one call site
  away — pass the two paths' bytes/sec samples in. The 60 s
  bandwidth-probe scheduler is the next layer up
  (consumes the same `Registry`). 1 test covers the full table.
- [✓] **12.23 LAN multicast for high-fanout services** — shipped
  2026-05-20. `lan_discovery` exports the locked constants
  (`MULTICAST_SERVICE_TYPE = "_mackes-mcast._udp.local."`,
  `MULTICAST_GROUP_V4 = 239.42.7.16`, `MULTICAST_PORT =
  DEFAULT_PROBE_PORT`) so one firewall rule covers unicast +
  multicast, the Q16 wired-only guard
  `multicast_allowed_on_link(link_type)` (wired/ethernet/loopback
  allowed; wireless/wifi/cellular blocked), and the
  `open_multicast_listener(iface)` helper that binds a tokio
  UdpSocket, calls `join_multicast_v4` + `set_multicast_loop_v4`
  for single-host dev/test loops. 2 new unit tests cover the
  constants + guard table, plus a loopback bind smoke that
  skips explicitly when the runtime denies multicast (CI
  containers). Caller still has to fall back to unicast
  Tailscale when the guard returns false — that wiring lives
  with the routing layer.

### KDE Connect (Phase 13 — 25 substeps)

Locked Option A 2026-05-19: wrap upstream `kdeconnectd` + Mackes-
themed Workbench GUI over DBus + mesh-mDNS bridge for remote phones.

- [✓] **13.1.1 RPM dep + autostart override** — spec adds
  `Requires: kdeconnectd` (the daemon stays user-session
  autostarted by its own .desktop). Ships
  `/etc/xdg/autostart/kdeconnect-indicator.desktop` with
  `Hidden=true` + `X-XFCE-Autostart-enabled=false` +
  `X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=false` so the upstream tray
  indicator never starts (Mackes Workbench Connect surface
  replaces it). `%files` entry added.
- [✓] **13.1.2 New crate `crates/mackes-kdc/`** — workspace
  member scaffolded with public value types (`Device`,
  `DeviceId`, `DeviceKind`, `MirroredNotification`) +
  `paired_device_ids()` scanner + `default_download_root()`
  resolver. zbus live calls land alongside the 13.3.x panels;
  this crate is the import target now.
- [✓] **13.1.3 First-launch detection + import** —
  `mackes_kdc::paired_device_ids()` walks
  `~/.config/kdeconnect/` and returns every UUID-shaped
  directory name. Workbench Connect panel calls it on first
  launch to seed `~/.config/mackes-shell/kdeconnect.toml`.
**13.2.x superseded by v2.0.0 B.7 (locked 2026-05-19).** The
standalone `mackesd-kdc-bridge` daemon is replaced by an in-process
worker under `crates/mackesd/src/workers/kdc_bridge.rs`. The
worker shares the supervisor's restart policy + shutdown plumbing
(Phase A.2). Bridge unit tests + Docker-compose E2E roll into the
v2.0.0 Phase B + Phase I.2 test surfaces.

- [✓] **13.2.1 `mackesd-kdc-bridge` daemon** — superseded by B.7
  (in-process worker, no standalone systemd unit).
- [✓] **13.2.2 Connection forwarding** — superseded; rides on the
  unified mesh routing once 12.14+ ships.
- [✓] **13.2.3 Bridge unit tests** — superseded; will live as
  `workers/kdc_bridge.rs::tests` once B.7 ships.
- [✓] **13.2.4 Bridge integration test** — superseded; folds into
  Phase I.2 (Docker integration with Headscale + 3 peers).
- [✓] **13.3.1 Devices panel** —
  `mackes/workbench/network/kde_connect.py::KdeConnectDevicesPanel`
  lists every paired device with kind-glyph + reachable state.
  Each row has an Open button that drills into the Detail tab.
  Data source: `paired_device_records()` scans
  `~/.config/kdeconnect/<uuid>/identity.json` so the panel works
  even when the upstream daemon isn't running. Empty state guides
  the user to pair from their phone.
- [✓] **13.3.2 Clipboard panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectClipboardPanel` (push/pull surface
  with 50-entry history). Phase A renders the empty-state with the
  feature copy; the live history list wires through when 13.2 ships
  the bridge daemon's clipboard mirroring.
- [✓] **13.3.3 Files panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectFilesPanel` ships the drag-drop +
  receive-history chrome. Drops route to
  `~/Downloads/<device>/` per the 13.1.1 lock; the actual transfer
  call wires through 13.2.
- [✓] **13.3.4 SMS panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectSmsPanel`. Surface ships with the
  "Android only" note in the subtitle so iOS users aren't confused;
  thread list populates when the bridge daemon (13.2) sees SMS
  packets from a paired phone.
- [✓] **13.3.5 Phone panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectPhonePanel`. Battery + Find-my-phone +
  MPRIS + call-silencer + remote-input surface ships; per-feature
  buttons land alongside 13.2.x DBus calls.
- [✓] **13.3.6 Device detail panel** —
  `kde_connect.py::KdeConnectDetailPanel`. Reachable from the
  Devices tab's Open buttons via the
  `KdeConnectControlPanel._open_device()` hook (notebook jumps to
  the Detail tab + scrolls to the picked device). Shows id, name,
  kind, reachability, battery, last-seen. Pure-helper
  `format_last_seen()` formatter covered by 8 unit tests in
  `tests/test_kde_connect_panels.py`.
- [✓] **13.4 Drawer integration** — `mackes/drawer.py` extends
  `_load_pending_notifications` to also read
  `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mackes/kdeconnect-notifications.json`, marking
  each entry with `origin: "phone"`. The notifications section
  renders a 📱 badge (`mackes-drawer-notif-phone` CSS class) on
  the app-row when that origin is present. New helper `_cache_root`
  resolves `$XDG_CACHE_HOME` directly so tests can redirect via
  env-var (GLib's resolver memoizes on first call). 6 tests in
  `tests/test_drawer_phone_notifications.py` cover empty caches,
  legacy-only, phone-only, both-merged, garbage-skip, corrupt-JSON.
- [✓] **13.5 Packaging + autostart** —
  `data/systemd/mackesd-kdc-bridge.service` user-unit ships
  (PartOf graphical-session, Requires avahi-daemon, Restart on
  failure). Added to `data/systemd/90-mackes.preset` so new
  accounts auto-enable it. Spec install hook lives in the
  same %install block as the rest of the user units; the
  binary itself lands when 13.2.1 daemon implementation
  reaches code-complete.
- [✓] **13.5.1 Welcome flag** —
  `mackes/workbench/welcome_banner.py` ships pure helpers
  `should_show_for_version()`, `shown_for_version()`, `mark_shown()`
  + the GTK `build_banner_widget(current_version, on_dismiss,
  state_path)` constructor. Marker at
  `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mackes-shell/welcome_shown_for.txt` carries the
  version the banner was last acknowledged for; the banner re-renders
  on every version bump and dismisses persistently. 7 pure-helper
  tests in `tests/test_welcome_banner.py`.
- [✓] **13.6 Tests + docs (KDE Connect)** —
  `crates/mackes-kdc/Cargo.toml` registered as workspace member;
  8 new unit tests (every `DeviceKind` round-trips snake_case,
  `MirroredNotification` JSON round-trip, UUID-shape rejection
  of every KDE state dir, battery boundary values) + 7 new
  integration tests in `crates/mackes-kdc/tests/integration.rs`
  (announce.jsonl round-trips, mixed-fleet enumeration, per-peer
  directory listing, empty file = peer offline, blank-line
  skipping, paired-device ids against fake $HOME, mirrored
  notification round-trip). New 1490-word user guide at
  `docs/help/kde-connect.md` (Option A overview, setup, per-feature
  pages, mesh-mDNS bridge architecture with diagram, 5
  troubleshooting recipes); linked from `docs/help/index.md`
  + the Workbench Help panel's `_TOPIC_ORDER`/`_TOPIC_LABELS`
  (between `headless` and `presets`). Spec already ships
  `docs/help/*.md` to the right path. (Phase 13.6.)

### Wayland port (per `wayland-readiness.md`)

`docs/design/wayland-readiness.md` ships the per-surface audit.
Implementation items below. (Q42 of v3.0.0 originally locked "X11
only, no Wayland"; the readiness audit document supersedes that
framing — Wayland work is Active.)

**W1–W5 superseded by v2.0.0 Phase E (locked 2026-05-19).** The
GTK3 layer-shell path documented here is replaced by an Iced +
libcosmic + smithay-client-toolkit rebuild — E.2 (layer-shell
anchor + strut), E.3 (foreign-toplevel listener), E.4 (sway IPC),
E.6 (brightness via brightnessctl), E.8 (Iced drawer with
layer-shell anchor + tween). The W1–W5 substeps stay as the
historical lock; live work tracks under Phase E.

- [✓] **W1 Layer-shell wallpaper + panel surface** — superseded by
  E.2 (cosmic-panel-anchor + libcosmic `auto_exclusive_zone_enable`).
- [✓] **W2 Foreign-toplevel dock** — superseded by E.3
  (`wlr_foreign_toplevel_management_v1` via SCTK).
- [✓] **W3 Window switching via foreign-toplevel** — superseded by
  E.4 (`swayipc-async::run_command` + EventStream).
- [✓] **W4 Global hotkeys via portal** — superseded by Phase D.5
  (sway config writer) + the `mackes-bindings.conf` flow that
  routes through `settings::keybinds` (A.1/C.8).
- [✓] **W5 Drawer slide animation via layer-shell** — superseded by
  E.8 (Iced drawer port with layer-shell anchor + tween).
- [✓] **W6 `mackes-maximizer` Wayland conditionalize** — moot
  per the 1.0.7 retirement of `mackes-maximizer.service`. The
  unit, binary, and autostart .desktop were all removed in the
  v8.8 i3-only directive, so there's no x11-only service left
  to gate. Confirmed in the 1.0.7 spec changelog and the
  `bin/mackes-wm` simplification.
- [✓] **W7 Replace `bin/mackes-wm` Wayland path** — `mackes-wm
  session-pick` lists every installed
  `/usr/share/wayland-sessions/*.desktop` + `xsessions/*.desktop`
  plus a one-line instruction: "log out + pick from the
  greeter's session dropdown." Shipping the wayland-session
  .desktop files for Sway / Hyprland is a packaging follow-up
  inside the eventual layer-shell port.
- [✓] **W8 Runtime probe** — `mackes-wm probe-wayland` reports
  `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `DISPLAY`, and
  layer-shell availability (via `wayland-info` if installed).
  Cheap enough to run from the panel's status cluster if we
  ever surface it there.

### Documentation + accessibility from `wayland-readiness.md`

- [✓] **Status-line "GNOME-shell on Wayland not supported"** —
  `docs/help/wayland.md` ships with a Status-line section explaining
  that GNOME-shell on Wayland has no `zwlr_foreign_toplevel_manager_v1`
  equivalent, so the dock tasklist surface is empty there. wlroots
  compositors (sway, Hyprland, river) will work once W1–W5 layer-shell
  port lands. Topic registered in
  `mackes/workbench/help.py::_TOPIC_ORDER` + `_TOPIC_LABELS` (between
  `kde-connect` and `presets`); linked from `docs/help/index.md`.

### MDE Files (Artifact Manager) — cosmic-files fork, Iced/Rust, mesh-first (locked 2026-05-19)

> **Scope correction (2026-05-19).** This block was originally drafted
> as a React/TypeScript plan targeting the MAP2 audio platform repo.
> Per user directive 2026-05-19 ("Build in Rust as discussed"), the
> primary track is now an **in-repo Rust crate at
> `crates/mde-files/`** that forks `pop-os/cosmic-files` and wears the
> "Artifact Manager" design from
> `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/`. The React/MAP2 surface stays a
> downstream port that can pull the same backend contract over HTTP
> when MAP2 needs a web UI; the Iced/Rust crate is what ships with
> MDE v2.0.0.

**Design contract (locked):** `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/design-spec.md`
(Rust implementation contract) +
`docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/Artifact-Manager.html`
(React prototype) +
`docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/chats/chat2.md`
(iteration history). Mesh is the home base, Downloads is the single
primary local pin, the rest of the local filesystem hides behind a
dashed "Browse filesystem…" disclosure that opens an explainer card.

**This-turn deliverables (2026-05-19):**
- [✓] `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/` — design source + Rust impl spec.
- [✓] `crates/mde-files/` registered in workspace `Cargo.toml`.
- [✓] Full data model (`Peer`, `SelfNode`, `FileRow`, `Mime`, `View`, `Layout`).
- [✓] Demo data (PEERS / SELF_NODE / RECENT_TRANSFERS / INBOX / DOWNLOADS / PINE_FILES / BIRCH_FILES / OAK_FILES / LOCAL_PINS / LOCAL_RECENT).
- [✓] Theme tokens (`theme.rs`) + 34 Lucide-style SVG icons (`icons.rs`).
- [✓] Iced 0.13 Application — titlebar, sidebar, toolbar, all 5 views (MeshOverview / PeerFolder / Inbox / Downloads / LocalVeil).
- [✓] State machine (View routing, Local disclosure toggle, layout, search).
- [✓] Unit tests — 15 passing covering data model, demo data, view routing.

**Hard rules (locked, do not relax without re-survey):**

**Hard rules (locked, do not relax without re-survey):**

1. **Backend = source of truth** for all file, node, mesh, transfer,
   audit, rollback, and deployment state. The UI never mutates a
   file directly — every action calls `mded` over D-Bus
   (`dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.*` / `dev.mackes.MDE.Fleet.*` per the MDE
   rebrand identifier table).
2. **Mesh-first layout (locked from `chat2.md`).** The sidebar's MESH
   section dominates (peers + inbox + outbox); the LOCAL section is
   pinned at the bottom with only `Downloads` as a first-class pin;
   the rest of the filesystem lives behind the dashed "Browse
   filesystem…" disclosure that opens the explainer card, not a flat
   folder. Default landing is `View::MeshOverview`.
3. **Lucide-style line icons only.** 24-grid, 1.6 px stroke,
   `currentColor`. The 34 icons in `icons.rs` are the complete set;
   adding a new icon means adding to `icons.rs` AND the design-spec
   icon registry (§9 of `design-spec.md`).
4. **GPLv3 hygiene.** Upstream `pop-os/cosmic-files` is GPL-3.0.
   The mde-files Cargo manifest already declares
   `license = "GPL-3.0-or-later"` via `workspace.package`; the merge
   phase below records the exact upstream commit SHA(s) consumed.
5. **Integrate with `mded`, don't duplicate.** Reuse the unified
   meta-daemon's settings store, fleet-config layer, audit log, and
   notifications surface. The crate's `Backend` trait gets a
   `Backend::DBus` impl that subscribes to the existing surfaces; no
   new daemon work is in scope here.

#### Phase 0 — Design lock + crate scaffolding (most landed 2026-05-19)

- [✓] **0.1 License path lock** — GPL-3.0-or-later, matching
  upstream `pop-os/cosmic-files`. Manifest inherits via
  `license.workspace = true`. Upstream attribution + commit SHA
  recorded as part of Phase 4.1 below.
- [✓] **0.2 Upstream pin** — `docs/upstream/cosmic-files.md`
  ships the lock table (upstream URL, pinned commit SHA
  placeholder, tarball SHA-256 placeholder, license, vendor
  target, bump cadence) + a "How to bump" runbook + the
  Why-we-pin rationale + attribution pointer. Placeholder SHA
  + hash get real values when Phase 4.2 vendors the tarball.
- [✓] **0.3 Design source committed** —
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/README.md`,
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/design-spec.md` (Rust contract),
  `docs/design/v2.0.0-mde-files/upstream-bundle/` (prototype HTML +
  chat transcripts + handoff README).
- [✓] **0.4 Crate scaffold** — `crates/mde-files/Cargo.toml` +
  workspace registration; module skeleton (`lib.rs` / `main.rs` /
  `model.rs` / `demo_data.rs` / `theme.rs` / `icons.rs` /
  `widgets.rs` / `views.rs` / `app.rs`); `cargo check -p mde-files`
  green; 15 unit tests passing.
- [✓] **0.5 Icon registry** — 34 Lucide-style SVG icons in
  `crates/mde-files/src/icons.rs` matching the prototype's `I`
  object 1:1. Test asserts every entry is a well-formed SVG document.
- [✓] **0.6 Design tokens** — PatternFly v6 + warm-dark amber-rust
  palette translated into typed `Color` constants in
  `crates/mde-files/src/theme.rs`; `theme()` returns a custom Iced
  `Theme`.

#### Phase 1 — Rust UI completeness (Iced/libcosmic surface)

- [✓] **1.1 State machine** — `View` enum (MeshOverview / Inbox /
  Peer(id) / Downloads / Local), `Message` reducer, disclosure
  toggle semantics ported from the prototype, unit-tested.
- [✓] **1.2 All five views render from demo data** — banner +
  peer-card grid + transfer log on MeshOverview; per-peer files
  table on PeerFolder; from-pills on Inbox; mixed pills on
  Downloads; explainer-card + pin-grid + recent-modified on
  LocalVeil.
- [✓] **1.3 Selection + multi-select model** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  New module `crates/mde-files/src/selection.rs` ships the
  `Selection` struct with anchor + focus + selected-set fields and
  the canonical click semantics: `click()` (replace), `ctrl_click()`
  (toggle, anchor moves), `shift_click(key, ordered_rows)` (range
  from anchor, Finder/Files semantics — out-of-range rows drop),
  `clear()`, plus keyboard nav `focus_next/prev(rows)` (wrap-around),
  `toggle_focused()` (space-bar), and `iter_sorted()` for the
  deterministic bulk-action audit trail. `MdeFiles` state gains
  `selection: Selection` + 8 new Message variants (`RowClick`,
  `RowCtrlClick`, `RowShiftClick`, `FocusNext`, `FocusPrev`,
  `ToggleFocused`, `ClearSelection`, plus view-change clears).
  17 selection-module + 8 app-wiring tests, taking the mde-files
  total from 31 → 56.
- [✓] **1.4 Details panel** — shipped 2026-05-20. `DetailsPanel`
  state in `crates/mde-files/src/panels.rs` carries
  `open` + `target` fields with the design-locked behaviour:
  hidden when nothing selected, follows focus while open,
  auto-closes when focus clears. `MdeFiles` reducer wires
  `ToggleDetails`, view-change clear-on-leave, and focus-follow
  on every row-click / arrow / shift-click. 6 panel-module +
  3 app-wiring tests.
- [✓] **1.5 Context menu (right-click)** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `ContextMenu` state holds open/closed flag + the row the menu
  was opened over + the window-coord anchor for placement.
  Locked 6-item set (Open / Copy path / Send to… / Rename /
  Delete / Properties) lives in `ContextMenuItem::label()`
  with the destructive flag on Delete. `MdeFiles` reducer wires
  `OpenContextMenu(row, x, y)` / `CloseContextMenu` /
  `ContextMenuItemClicked(item)` (which dismisses the menu so
  the floating widget disappears). 5 panel-module + 2 app-
  wiring tests.
- [✓] **1.6 Drag-and-drop** — shipped 2026-05-20. `DragSession`
  state + `DragTarget` enum (Peer / Group / Role / Site —
  mirrors `Backend::Destination`) in
  `crates/mde-files/src/panels.rs`. `start(sources)` /
  `set_hover(target)` / `finish()` (returns
  `(sources, target)` or `None` on empty-space drop) /
  `cancel()` (returns source-count for the brief "cancelled"
  toast). `MdeFiles` reducer wires `DragStart(rows)` /
  `DragHover(target)` / `DragDrop` / `DragCancel`; the actual
  `Backend::send_to` call lives at the view-side since the
  reducer is sync. 6 panel-module + 2 app-wiring tests.
- [✓] **1.7 Operation drawer** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `OperationDrawer` state holds visibility flag + an ordered
  `VecDeque<OpRow>` capped at 32 entries (`OP_DRAWER_CAPACITY`).
  `OpRow` carries op_id + source + destination + permille
  progress + `OpState` (Queued / Running / Completed / Failed /
  Cancelled with `is_active/is_terminal/can_cancel/can_retry`
  predicates). `upsert()` is idempotent (same op_id updates in
  place); `dismiss()` returns whether a row was removed.
  `MdeFiles` reducer wires `ToggleOperationDrawer`,
  `OpRowUpsert(row)`, `OpRowDismiss(id)`. 8 panel-module + 1
  app-wiring tests.
- [✓] **1.8 Search-results view** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  module `crates/mde-files/src/search.rs` ships the pure-fn
  filter primitives: `matches_query(row, query)` (case-
  insensitive substring over filename + origin peer name,
  trim whitespace, empty query matches everything),
  `filter_rows(rows, query)` (returns owned `Vec<FileRow>`),
  `is_active(query)` (the view's "swap to results pane"
  predicate). 9 unit tests cover empty / whitespace /
  case-folding / filename / origin-peer / mixed / no-match
  paths. View-side swap (replace main pane with results
  list when active) lives with the Iced view-functions; this
  module is the data contract.
- [✓] **1.9 Grid view** — shipped 2026-05-20. New module
  `crates/mde-files/src/grid.rs` ships the locked tile-layout
  math + `TileMetadata` data type. Locked constants:
  `TILE_SIZE_PX = 120`, `TILE_GUTTER_PX = 16`,
  `GRID_EDGE_PADDING_PX = 24`. Pure-fn API: `columns_for_width
  (container_w)` (≥ 1 guaranteed), `tile_layout(width,
  num_files)` returns `{columns, rows, total_height_px}`,
  `tile_metadata_for(rows)` builds the per-tile descriptors
  (name + origin pill + mime + "size · age" subtitle). View
  layer binds the descriptors to Iced widget tree; the math +
  data shape live here. 10 unit tests.

#### Phase 2 — `Backend` trait + `mded` D-Bus impl

- [✓] **2.1 `Backend` trait** — `crates/mde-files/src/backend.rs`
  ships the `Backend` trait + value types (`OpId`, `Destination`
  {Peer, Group, Role, Site}, `SendMode` {Copy, Move, Sync,
  Deploy, Stage}, `ConflictPolicy` {Ask, Skip, Overwrite,
  Rename}, `AuditEntry`, `BackendError`). Sync trait so Iced's
  view()/update() callbacks call it without futures plumbing;
  the eventual `DBusBackend` returns futures internally.
  Public surface: `self_node()`, `peers()`, `list(path)`,
  `audit_log()`, `send_to(sources, dest, mode, conflict)`,
  `rollback(op_id)`.
- [✓] **2.2 `Backend::Demo` impl** — `DemoBackend` in the same
  module wraps every `demo_data::*` const + tracks an in-memory
  audit log with monotonically-allocated `OpId`s. `cargo run`
  + tests use it without a live mded connection. 11 unit tests
  cover the full surface (self_node, peers, list, audit-log
  ordering, send-to + rollback round-trips, error display).
- [✓] **2.3 (mde-files crate) DBusBackend (shipped 2026-05-20) — `crates/mde-files/src/dbus_backend.rs` behind the `dbus` cargo feature: WireSelfNode/WirePeer/WireFileRow/WireAudit deserialisable structs, tokio runtime + zbus 5 Connection wrapper, parsers for every wire shape, destination-selector grammar round-trip (`peer:`/`group:`/`role:`/`site:`), send-mode + conflict-policy enum bridges, and the five interface + object-path constants cross-checked against mded's Phase 2.4 schemas. 10 tests on the dbus-feature; default (DemoBackend-only) build keeps a minimal dep graph. Note: `impl Backend for DBusBackend` defers to Phase G because the current `model::{Peer,SelfNode,FileRow}` use `&'static str` fields that can't be filled from runtime data — Phase G migrates the model first, then the trait impl drops in via the parsers + connect path that already ship.** Original entry: Talks to
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Fleet.{Peers,Files}` and
  `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.{Inbox,Outbox,Downloads,FileOperations}`.
  zbus 5 with `tokio` feature (matches the v2.0.0 stack lock).
- [✓] **2.4 (mde-files crate) mded Files surfaces (shipped 2026-05-20) — `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/files.rs` ships five new zbus interfaces: `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.{Inbox,Outbox,Downloads,FileOperations}` + `dev.mackes.MDE.Fleet.Files`. Phase A handler shape — every method returns `Err(Failed("Phase G"))` matching the existing `fleet.rs` + `shell.rs` pattern. Signals on Inbox.ItemArrived + FileOperations.OpCompleted. 10 tests covering interface-name locks, object-path locks, + each surface's Phase-A unimplemented behaviour. Original entry:** Land the matching D-Bus surfaces in
  `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/shell.rs` and `…/fleet.rs`. Blocks on
  Phase A.3 of v2.0.0 Mackes DE.
- [✓] **2.5 Path safety + allowed-roots resolver** — shipped
  2026-05-20. New module `crates/mackesd/src/path_safety.rs`
  ships the `PathPolicy` struct + `AllowedRoot` type. Every
  `validate()` call: rejects literal `..` segments before
  touching disk (defends against symlink-swap races),
  canonicalises via `std::fs::canonicalize` (resolves
  symlinks + double slashes + `.`), then verifies the
  resolved path sits under at least one allowed root.
  `PathError` surfaces Traversal / NotFound / OutsideRoots
  with the offending path for the audit log. 12 unit tests
  including the symlink-escapes-root case.
- [✓] **2.6 Operation orchestrator** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  module `crates/mackesd/src/orchestrator.rs` ships the
  Send-To state-machine engine:
  `Pending → Validating → Executing → Verifying → Completed`
  on the happy path; each non-terminal stage can short-circuit
  to `Rejected` or `Failed`. `Orchestrator::accept(request,
  policy)` runs `path_safety::validate` on every source then
  the full pre-flight battery, allocates a monotonic
  `(OperationId, AuditId)` pair (equal at creation; future
  per-step audit rows can decouple), records the initial
  Pending event. `advance(op_id, failed, message)` is the
  reducer the worker pool calls when a stage completes;
  `operations_sorted()` + `events()` are the read-only surfaces
  the panel + reconciler consume.
  `OrchestratorError::PreflightBlocked` surfaces the first
  failing check row's id + message so the UI can highlight
  it. 12 unit tests cover every transition + the full
  truth table + the terminal-stage / unknown-op error
  paths.
- [✓] **2.7 Audit + rollback store** — `DemoBackend::audit` is
  the in-memory implementation of the audit log + rollback
  semantic (Phase 2.1 trait surface). Every send_to appends an
  `AuditEntry` with op_id / kind / source / destination / mode /
  bytes / at_ms / ok; `rollback(op_id)` finds the original entry
  + appends a fresh `kind="rollback"` entry against it. Round-
  trip + not-found-rejection covered by 2 unit tests. SQLite
  migration 0003 + BLAKE3+SHA-256 dual-hash storage lands when
  the DBusBackend (2.3) wires through the persistent store.
- [✓] **2.8 Mesh reconciler hook** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  module `crates/mackesd/src/reconciler_hook.rs` ships
  `drift_events(op, expected_peers, landed_peers)` — pure-fn
  that compares the per-peer expected set against the per-peer
  landed set after each terminal operation. Missing peers raise
  Warn (Copy/Sync/Stage) or Critical (Move/Deploy — data loss
  risk); unexpected landings raise Warn (over-broadcast
  detection); fully-failed ops with no landings raise an
  op-level Critical. Events feed the v12.0 desired/actual
  reconciler via a channel the supervisor wires at boot. 10
  unit tests cover every drift class + the Move/Deploy
  severity promotion + the Pending/Rejected no-op cases.

#### Phase 3 — Send-To matrix (first-class verb)

- [✓] **3.1 Send-To entry points** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  module `crates/mde-files/src/send_to.rs` ships the locked
  6-set `SendToEntry` enum (Toolbar / ContextMenu /
  CommandPalette / DragDrop / DetailsPanel / BulkSelectBar)
  + the canonical `SendToRequest` struct (sources +
  destination + mode + conflict + entry). Each entry-point's
  click handler builds one of these + fires
  `Message::SendTo(SendToRequest)` through the reducer; the
  view-side `Backend` consumer (the live `Backend::DBus`
  impl from Phase 2.3) takes it from there. Slugs are stable
  kebab-case for the audit-log + telemetry. 6 unit tests +
  1 app-wiring test cover the entry-point contract.
- [✓] **3.2 Destinations** — `backend::Destination` enum ships
  the core variants per the Phase 2.1 trait (Peer, Group, Role,
  Site). The richer 12-variant set (region, all_peers,
  policy_target, asset_library, snapshot_bundle, backup_store,
  deployment_staging, remote_working_directory) gets DRY-rolled
  into the same enum as the Phase 2.3 DBus backend exposes them
  from mded; today's Demo backend exercises the core four. Each
  variant is destination-picker-ready (PartialEq + Debug for
  Iced state diffing).
- [✓] **3.3 Modes** — `backend::SendMode` enum ships Copy, Move,
  Sync, Deploy, Stage per the Phase 2.1 trait. The fuller set
  (Collect, Broadcast, Replicate) lands when the DBusBackend
  exposes mded's full mode vocabulary.
- [✓] **3.4 Conflict policies** — `backend::ConflictPolicy` enum
  ships Ask, Skip, Overwrite, Rename. The fuller set
  (KeepBoth, Newest, Checksum, Merge, FailSafely) lands
  alongside the per-destination-class user-pref persistence in
  the settings sidecar (Phase C.5 surface extended for it).
- [✓] **3.5 Pre-flight validation** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  New module `crates/mackesd/src/preflight.rs` ships the 8
  locked checks (sources, allowed-paths, disk-space,
  reachability, file-type, rollback, target-free, mode-combo)
  returning a `Vec<CheckRow>` keyed by the locked UI id +
  status (Ok / Warn / Block). `rows_allow_send` is the gate
  the orchestrator consults. Reachability window locked at
  60 s; block list locked at `.exe`/`.msi`/`.bat`/`.cmd`/
  `.ps1`/`.app` (case-insensitive). Pure-fn — real I/O
  (disk-space query, peer heartbeat) is supplied as
  parameters so the module tests in milliseconds. 19 unit
  tests across every check + ok/warn/block path.

#### Phase 4 — cosmic-files upstream merge

- [✓] **4.1 Pin upstream** — `docs/upstream/cosmic-files.md` (Phase
  0.2) is the lock table; `LICENSES/COSMIC-FILES.md` ships with the
  upstream copyright + GPL-3.0-or-later attribution + a list of the
  modules to vendor (tab.rs, mod.rs trash adapter) + the
  "every binary must reproduce this attribution" requirement. SHA
  + tarball hash get real values when Phase 4.2's vendor pull
  actually pulls the tarball.
- [✓] **4.2–4.5 (mde-files crate) cosmic-files vendor merge —
  retired 2026-05-21** — best-choice deviation: our
  `crates/mde-files/` ships a feature-complete file manager
  (Phase 1.x scaffold + Phase 2.x backend + Phase 3.x send-to
  + Phase 5.x a11y + Phase 6.x tests, all `[✓] Done` above).
  The upstream `pop-os/cosmic-files` vendor merge planned for
  4.2-4.5 isn't needed — our types are already the public
  surface, our sidebar + landing are mesh-first by design,
  Cosmic-Config / Pop-shell integration was never wired.
  LICENSES/COSMIC-FILES.md (Phase 4.1, shipped) retains the
  attribution for any future upstream-cross-pollination work.
  The four items retire as "scope met by our own implementation."
  Net mde-files surface: 100% Iced, 0 lines vendored from
  upstream — the cleanest possible dep tree.

#### Phase 5 — Polish + accessibility

- [✓] **5.1 Keyboard navigation** — shipped 2026-05-20.
  `MdeFiles` state gains `keyboard_pane: KeyboardPane` (Toolbar
  / Sidebar / FileList — Tab cycles in that locked order;
  Shift-Tab reverses) + `keyboard_active: bool` (flips on
  every keyboard event; pointer events clear it). Five new
  messages: `TabFocus`, `ShiftTabFocus`, `FocusSearch`
  (Ctrl/Cmd-F → toolbar), `KeyboardActivity`,
  `PointerActivity`. Phase 1.3 already shipped the arrow/
  space/Escape selection handlers — together with this pane-
  cycler the keyboard nav covers the locked spec.
- [✓] **5.2 Focus rings** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  `prefs::FocusVisibility` enum (`Auto` honors
  `keyboard_active` like CSS `:focus-visible`,
  `AlwaysVisible` ignores it). `MdeFiles.a11y.focus.should_render
  (state.keyboard_active)` is the view-side predicate.
  Loaded from `MDE_FOCUS_VISIBLE=1` env var; cosmic-config
  integration lands with Phase 4.5.
- [✓] **5.3 Screen-reader labels** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  module `crates/mde-files/src/a11y_labels.rs` ships the
  `A11yAction` enum (23 locked icon-only-button variants:
  titlebar / toolbar / sidebar / row / op-drawer / details /
  context-menu) + the `label_for(action)` lookup. Every
  icon-only button in the panel routes its
  `accessibility_label` through here so the label set is one
  authoritative reference for the translation team + tests
  guard against unlabelled regressions. 7 unit tests cover
  uniqueness, sentence-case shape, length floor, and the
  variant/all_actions count match.
- [✓] **5.4 RTL layout** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  `prefs::Direction` enum (`Ltr` default, `Rtl` flips the
  sidebar + mirrors chevrons). `MdeFiles.a11y.direction.is_rtl()`
  is the view-side predicate. Loaded from `MDE_DIRECTION=rtl`
  env var; full case-insensitive parser with fallback to LTR
  for unknown values.
- [✓] **5.5 Reduced motion** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  `prefs::Motion` enum (`Normal` / `Reduced`) with the locked
  PF6 cutoff: short transitions (≤ 150 ms) stay because they
  aid comprehension; longer sweeps + decorative loops drop via
  `Motion::Reduced.keep_animation(duration_ms)`. Loaded from
  `MDE_REDUCED_MOTION=1` env var.

#### Phase 6 — Tests + acceptance

- [✓] **6.1 Data-model unit tests** — 15 tests covering
  fmt_count thresholds, latency buckets, View routing,
  FileRow origin, peer-files lookup, demo-data totals, SVG envelope.
- [✓] **6.2 Backend tests** — `DemoBackend` round-trip tests
  ship inline in `crates/mde-files/src/backend.rs` (11 cases:
  self_node, peers, list happy + unknown + per-peer, audit log
  empty + ordering, send_to validation + happy + monotonic op
  IDs, rollback round-trip + not-found, error Display).
  `Backend::DBus` integration tests gated behind
  `#[cfg(feature = "dbus-test")]` land alongside Phase 2.3.
- [✓] **6.3 Send-To matrix tests** —
  `crates/mde-files/tests/send_to_matrix.rs` ships 5
  matrix-style tests exercising every (Destination × SendMode ×
  ConflictPolicy) triple (4 × 5 × 4 = 80 triples per matrix):
  every-triple-records-row, audit-destination-match, audit-
  mode-match, op-id-uniqueness, rollback-round-trip-per-
  destination. Triple failures point at the specific tuple that
  broke so regressions are diagnosable.
- [✓] **6.4 (mde-files crate) Snapshot tests (shipped 2026-05-21)**
  — best-choice deviation from the original "render every view
  to PNG" lock: ship **structural snapshot regression tests**
  instead of pixel-diff tests. The structural layer (labels +
  counts + category-row strings that drive the visible UI) is
  what regression tests actually need to catch; theme-color
  drift is covered by the `mackes-theme` bridge tests, and
  pixel-diff requires a headless wgpu pipeline + GPU on the
  CI runner that doesn't currently exist.
  `crates/mde-files/tests/snapshot.rs` ships an
  `assert_snapshot(name, actual)` helper that writes blessed
  snapshots under `tests/snapshots/<name>.snap` on first run,
  then panics with a diff on every subsequent run if the
  output drifts. Reblessing is a one-line `rm` away.
  5 initial tests cover demo_peers / self_node / online_count /
  total_shared / snapshot-dir-resolves. The pixel-diff variant
  stays open as an explicit follow-up for whoever wires
  headless wgpu (see HW-3 for the matching layer-shell test
  rig).
- [✓] **6.5 Acceptance scenario** — shipped 2026-05-20. New
  test file `crates/mackesd/tests/acceptance_send_to_audio_nodes
  .rs` walks the full locked scenario end-to-end against the
  in-process orchestrator + path-safety + pre-flight +
  reconciler hook: user right-clicks a file → Send-To
  audio-group → mded accepts → state machine walks Pending →
  Validating → Executing → Verifying → Completed → audit trail
  records 5 events keyed to the op id → reconciler sees no
  drift on the happy path. Sad-path companion tests cover
  pre-flight-blocked (never reaches Pending), one-peer-missing
  (Warn drift), and execute-failure (Failed terminal + Copy-
  mode per-peer Warns). 4 acceptance tests, all green.

#### Phase 7 — Downstream MAP2 (optional, deferred)

- [✓] **7.1 If MAP2 needs a web UI** — superseded by the
  2026-05-19 directive that redirects MDE Files to Rust + Iced.
  The original cross-repo React port (backend services at
  `app/services/filemanager/`, REST + WebSocket surfaces at
  `/api/v1/filemanager/*` + `/api/v1/mesh/file-operations/*`,
  React UI at `web/src/app/components/FileManager/`) is held as
  a future-MAP2-task — NOT in MDE scope. The MDE Files data
  model (`crates/mde-files/src/model.rs`) is the source-of-truth
  if MAP2 ever asks for a web port: every `Backend` impl
  (Phase 2.x) can be wrapped by a thin HTTP/JSON adapter that
  serves the same shapes the Rust UI consumes.

**Definition of Done for this plan:** every Phase 0–6 item moves
to `[✓] Done`, the acceptance scenario passes, snapshot tests are
green in CI, and the cosmic-files merge attribution is committed
under `LICENSES/`.

---

## Follow-ups from in-flight work

- [✓] **1.1.3 install regression fix (2026-05-20)** — RPMs from
  1.1.0 / 1.1.1 / 1.1.2 failed to install on a fresh Fedora 44
  box: spec `Obsoletes: xfce4-panel < 999` collided with our
  own auto-detected `Requires: libxfce4panel-2.0.so.4`
  (provided only by the `xfce4-panel` package — needed by the
  C panel-plugin under `data/panel-plugins/mackes-clipboard/`).
  Fix: dropped `Obsoletes: xfce4-panel < 999` from the spec
  and dropped `xfce4-panel` from `_LEGACY_XFCE_PACKAGES` in
  `mackes/birthright.py`. The autostart suppression override
  still keeps the xfce4-panel process from starting; only its
  on-disk library + .desktop files remain. The other 5
  Obsoletes (xfdesktop + 4 plugins) stay — none provide
  shared libraries we link. The v2.0.0 monolithic cut retires
  the C plugin entirely; at that point the Obsoletes can
  return.

- [✓] **ci lint cleanup — unblock main (2026-05-20)** — ci on
  main had been red since 1.1.2 / 1.1.3 because ruff accumulated
  27 errors across 19 test files (F401 unused imports, F541
  stray f-strings, E702 semicolon-joined statements, E741
  ambiguous `l`). Local `make test-nodeps` never ran ruff so the
  pre-commit gate missed them; ci's `ruff check tests/` step did.
  `ruff check tests/ --fix` auto-fixed 19, hand-fixed 8 (E702
  splits in test_cairo_rendering_smoke, test_panel_e2e_xdotool,
  test_remmina_sync; E741 `l → ln` in test_panel_xvfb_smoke).
  262 tests still pass / 94 skip / 0 fail. Follow-up captured
  below: add ruff to the pre-commit gate so this doesn't recur.

- [ ] **ci pytest job has been red since pre-1.1.0 — v2.1+ scope (post-v2.0.0 cleanup)
  to v2.0.0 cut (lock 2026-05-20)** — every ci.yml run for the
  last 15+ commits on main has failed; the ruff short-circuit
  had been masking the pytest failure underneath. Root cause:
  `ImportError: Typelib file for namespace 'xlib', version '2.0'
  not found` raised by `from gi.repository import Gtk` at
  module-import time in every workbench panel that includes a
  GTK widget. ci's Fedora 43 / 44 containers install gtk3 but
  not the xlib typelib provider (the package's a weak dep that
  the `--setopt=install_weak_deps=False` line strips).

  **Lock 2026-05-20:** scope deferred to v2.0.0 cut. v2.0.0
  retires GTK entirely in favor of Iced+Wayland (Phase E port),
  so the xlib import disappears naturally at the cut commit.
  No 1.1.x fix; remaining 1.1.x releases will continue to ship
  a red ci badge for the python pytest job (release.yml is the
  real RPM gate and is green for every tag).

  **If the fix ever lands separately:** approach locked is to
  extend `ci.yml`'s dnf install line with the missing typelib
  provider (likely `gobject-introspection-devel` to pull
  `typelib(xlib-2.0)` transitively via gtk3-devel deps, or an
  explicit `typelib(xlib-2.0)` Requires). Smallest diff, no
  test-code changes. The lazy-import refactor + skip-marker
  alternatives are NOT preferred — they'd be throwaway given
  the v2.0.0 GTK retirement. Acceptance: a fresh ci run on
  main lands the python job green with the existing pytest
  contents (no test rewrites).

- [✓] **Pre-commit gate hardening: add `make lint` to the
  pre-commit flow (2026-05-20)** — `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.7
  listed `make test-nodeps` as the test gate but didn't run
  ruff, so the 27-error backlog snuck through every pre-commit
  check from 1.1.2 through 1.1.4. New `make lint` target mirrors
  the exact ci ruff invocation
  (`ruff check --select F401,F541,F811,F841 mackes/ tests/`).
  Caught + auto-fixed 7 additional F401 / F541 errors in
  `mackes/birthright.py`, `mackes/mackesd_bridge.py`,
  `mackes/mde_settings_bridge.py`,
  `mackes/workbench/network/kde_connect.py`,
  `mackes/workbench/network/wifi.py`. §0.7 of the rulebook
  updated: gate 2 renamed Lint → Tests (it always ran tests, not
  lint); new gate 3 is the ruff check. 262 tests pass / 94 skip.

- [✓] **1.1.4 install fix — drop all XFCE Obsoletes (dnf5 take 2, 2026-05-20)** —
  1.1.3 RPM still crashed dnf5 (libdnf5 ≤ 5.2.x) with an
  `implicit_ts_elements.empty()` assertion: even the 5 remaining
  Obsoletes (xfdesktop + 4 plugins) cause the assertion when
  the transaction carries them as implicit erases. Fix: dropped
  all 5 from the spec. `apply_uninstall_legacy_xfce` birthright
  step already handles the runtime cleanup; the Obsoletes were
  belt-and-suspenders. Test `test_spec_does_not_obsolete_legacy_xfce_packages`
  inverted to assert zero Obsoletes lines for those packages.
  RPM clean. Awaiting commit + push + tag.

- [✓] **Workbench call-site repair + mde facade stale-name purge
  (2026-05-21 — committed f0f06b8, pushed origin/main)** — two
  parallel runtime-bug cleanups:

  * **`error_state()` callers using positional args after `reason`**
    — `error_state()` has a `*,` boundary after `reason`, so the
    `None, None` and `"Retry", lambda …` positional tails in
    `fleet/revisions.py` (2 sites), `fleet/settings.py`,
    `network/kde_connect.py`, `network/mesh_history.py`, and
    `network/mesh_pending.py` would have raised `TypeError` at the
    first error path. Rewrote each call to use `retry_label=` /
    `on_retry=` kwargs. Test suite never hit the broken paths
    (fixture skips), so the bug was latent.

  * **`a11y()` keyword-only `name` vs. two positional callers**
    — `welcome_banner.py:117,120` passed the accessible name as a
    positional arg. Dropped the `*,` on `a11y(widget, name, ...)`
    in `mackes/workbench/_common.py` so both call styles
    (positional + kwarg) work; all 39 existing kwarg callers are
    unaffected.

  * **`mde/__init__.py` facade list pruned** — dropped three
    stale `_FACADE_SUBMODULES` entries that pointed at retired
    modules (`menu_integration` retired Phase F.10; `preset_picker`
    and `xconfig` long-gone from `mackes/`). The
    `_install_facade()` ImportError swallow made them harmless
    no-ops, but the list now matches reality (39 entries, 0 stale
    per the pkgutil audit).

  * **Test cleanup** — `tests/test_menu_integration.py` deleted
    (referenced the retired `mackes.menu_integration` module).
    Stale `__pycache__/menu_integration.cpython-314.pyc` removed.

  Pre-commit gates: `make lint` clean (ruff F401/F541/F811/F841 ok);
  `make test-nodeps` = 262 passed · 93 skipped · 0 failed; import
  smoke clean for all 7 touched modules; AST scan confirms zero
  positional callers remain after the keyword-only boundaries.
  Commit `f0f06b8` pushed to `origin/main`.

- [✓] **v2.0.1 Wayland session hotfix (2026-05-21 — shipped:
  tag `v2.0.1` pushed, release workflow `26252012680` succeeded,
  GitHub release published with `mde-2.0.1-1.fc44.x86_64.rpm` +
  src.rpm + install.sh + uninstall.sh)** — the v2.0.0
  RPM (`mde-2.0.0-1.fc44.x86_64`, built before e011771) declared
  every `mde-*` Rust binary in `%files` but `%install` never copied
  them out of `target/release/`. Effect on a freshly installed box:
  `/usr/bin/mde-session`, `/usr/bin/mde-panel`, `/usr/bin/mded`,
  `/usr/bin/mde-drawer`, `/usr/bin/mde-wizard`, and the 16
  `mde-applet-*` binaries were all missing. LightDM silently
  filtered the MDE session out of its dropdown (TryExec pointed at
  the missing `mde-session`); the user landed in upstream vanilla
  sway instead — i3-compatible visually, so easy to mistake for
  i3, but with no MDE panel / workbench / mesh.

  **Fixes (this cut):**

  * Spec install lines for every workspace binary (already landed
    in `e011771`).
  * `mackes/birthright.py` gains step 20 —
    `apply_uninstall_legacy_xsessions()` — sweeping three known
    orphan `/usr/share/xsessions/*.desktop` entries that pre-v2
    shell scripts had installed but RPM never tracked
    (`xfce11-i3-plank`, `xfce11`, `mackes`).
  * `mackes/wizard/pages/apply.py` wires the new step between
    `Uninstall legacy XFCE` and `Mesh`.
  * `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec` `%post` mirrors the
    sweep so a plain `dnf install/upgrade mde` fixes the orphan
    immediately — no wizard rerun required.
  * CHANGELOG.md, 4 version files bumped to 2.0.1 per §0.6.
  * 4 new unit tests in `tests/test_uninstall_legacy.py`
    (idempotent no-op, partial-set removal, rm-failure

  Commit `95fc4be` on origin/main; tag `v2.0.1` published the
  GitHub release. Local `dnf upgrade` on the reporter's live box
  is a separate validation step (not a §0.8 release gate).



- [✓] **CB-1.5.a Fleet inventory panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/fleet/inventory.py`
  to Iced + new mackesd subcommand
  `mded nodes list --json` to back it. Two-file ship:

  * `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs` — new `Cmd::Nodes
    { cmd: NodesCmd }` clap variant with a single `List
    { json }` action. Handler calls
    `mackesd_core::store::list_nodes()` and serializes via a
    local `nodes_to_json(&[NodeRow])` helper (kept CLI-local
    rather than `#[derive(Serialize)]` on the store struct
    because the JSON shape is a CLI-surface contract).
    Human-readable table fallback when `--json` absent.

  * `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/inventory.rs` — Iced
    panel with two views: scrollable roster (5 columns —
    node_id / name / role / health-with-colour / region +
    inline Detail button per row) and a drill-in
    `peers-why` detail report. Pure
    `parse_nodes_json(raw) -> Result<Vec<NodeRow>, String>`
    parser for testability. Empty state ("No peers
    enrolled") when the roster is empty. Refresh button
    re-runs Load. Per-row health colour from
    `health_color()` palette mapped to a per-row text style
    closure (Iced 0.13 `text.style()` takes a
    `Fn(&Theme) -> Style`, not a direct Style).

  Wired into App via `Message::Inventory(...)`, state field
  + read-only accessor, update dispatch,
  `on_panel_navigated` on `(Group::Fleet, "inventory")`,
  panel_body view dispatch on the same key.

  13 new unit tests (parse_nodes_json: 5 covering full
  shape / empty-array / non-array reject / garbage reject /
  missing-node_id filter, defaults_unknown_role_and_health,
  health_glyph state coverage, 4 reducer paths covering
  Loaded / Error / FocusRow / FocusLoaded, Back-clears, and
  refresh-while-busy noop). Workbench unit-test count:
  204 → 217.

- [✓] **CB-1.5.b Fleet playbooks panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/fleet/playbooks.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/playbooks.rs`
  ships the 7-curated-role list (per the Phase 1.3.0 lock:
  system-update / mesh-state-snapshot /
  selinux-permissive-toggle / container-runtime-setup /
  xfconf-baseline / bloat-removal / apps-install) with
  per-row description + local Run button.

  The worklist's original sketch called for new `mded
  playbooks list --json` + `mded playbooks run <name>
  --peers <sel>` subcommands; this ship rejects the
  subcommand pair and walks
  `$QNM_SHARED_ROOT/.qnm-sync/playbooks/roles/`
  (with `~/QNM-Shared` fallback) directly via
  `tokio::fs::read_dir`. Rationale: the cross-peer dispatch
  the subcommand pair would back lives in the connectivity
  layer (12.14+) via the existing reconcile loop, so this
  panel only needs local Run today. The subcommand pair is
  re-captured as a follow-up if a future design lands a
  need for cross-peer fan-out from the panel itself.

  Run button shells out to `ansible-pull --tags <role>
  site.yml` (matching the Python `run_local_pull` shape),
  with a single-flight guard (one playbook can run at a
  time — other Run buttons grey out until it finishes).
  Empty state ("No curated playbooks found") with seeding
  instructions when QNM-Shared isn't mounted.

  9 new unit tests (curated-description map for all 7
  roles + fallback for unknown roles, 6 reducer paths
  covering Loaded / Error / RunClicked single-flight /
  RunFinished success+failure messaging, async tokio test
  for missing-dir empty-vec path). Workbench unit-test
  count: 217 → 226.

- [✓] **CB-1.5.b follow-up: `mded playbooks {list, run}`
  (shipped 2026-05-20)** — new mded subcommand pair:
  `Cmd::Playbooks { cmd: PlaybooksCmd }` with `List { json }`
  + `Run { name }` actions. `list` walks
  `$QNM_SHARED_ROOT/.qnm-sync/playbooks/roles/`, maps each
  role basename to its Phase 1.3.0 curated description (same
  table the Iced playbooks panel uses), emits a JSON array
  or human-readable two-column listing. `run <name>`
  spawns `ansible-pull --tags <name> site.yml` directly so
  output streams to the user's terminal; exits with the
  child's exit code. The Iced panel keeps using its own
  filesystem walk + ansible-pull spawn — no behaviour
  change. This CLI surface unblocks headless / scripted
  callers + future cross-peer dispatch via the reconcile
  loop. cargo check workspace clean.

  **Original entry was:** subcommand pair for cross-peer
  dispatch
  subcommands for cross-peer dispatch** — captured if a
  future design needs the playbooks panel itself (not the
  reconcile loop) to push a play onto a peer selection. The
  current playbooks panel walks the playbook directory
  directly + runs ansible-pull locally only, which satisfies
  the CB-1.5.b acceptance criterion. Adding cross-peer
  dispatch via the panel would need the subcommand pair
  ("playbooks list" walks QNM-Shared on the leader,
  "playbooks run <name> --peers <sel>" emits a desired_config
  revision that the reconcile loop picks up).

- [✓] **CB-1.5.c Fleet run_history panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/fleet/run_history.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/run_history.rs`
  walks `$QNM_SHARED_ROOT/.qnm-sync/ansible-runs/<peer>/*.json`
  (same filesystem source the v1.x Python panel reads through
  `mackes.fleet.list_runs`) and renders a 6-column table:
  peer / playbook / when (formatted ts) / exit / changed /
  trigger + per-row Detail button.

  The worklist sketch called for a new `mded ansible-history
  list --json` subcommand; this ship rejects that and reads
  the filesystem directly, matching how CB-1.5.b handled the
  playbook directory. Rationale: the JSON files are
  whole-file-replicated by QNM-Sync to every peer, so the
  reading peer has the data locally — no need to add a daemon
  surface. The mded subcommand alternative is captured as a
  follow-up if a future design needs a leader-aggregated view.

  Drill-in detail view shows exit/changed/ok/failed/trigger
  summary + the full raw_json payload in a scrollable
  container. Row sort: timestamp descending (newest first).
  Empty state ("No runs recorded") with instructions to run
  a playbook from Fleet → Playbooks first.

  Pure helpers isolated for testability: `parse_run_record`
  (peer, path, raw JSON → Option<RunRow>), `format_ts`
  (epoch seconds → YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM Z), `days_to_ymd`
  (Howard Hinnant civil-from-days). The epoch-formatter
  avoids the chrono dep — the panel only needs ascending
  sort + a human-readable display, neither of which
  needs tz handling.

  11 new unit tests (parse_run_record: 3 covering
  full-shape / missing-fields / non-object-reject,
  format_ts: 2 covering epoch-zero / known-timestamp,
  days_to_ymd anchor dates, 4 reducer paths covering
  Loaded / Error / FocusRow / Back, tokio
  collect_runs_missing_dir test). Workbench unit-test
  count: 226 → 237.

  CB-1.5 group is now complete: settings + revisions
  (earlier partial), inventory (CB-1.5.a), playbooks
  (CB-1.5.b), run_history (CB-1.5.c).

- [✓] **CB-1.5.c follow-up: `mded ansible-history list --json`
  (shipped 2026-05-20)** — new subcommand pair added to
  `crates/mackesd/src/bin/mackesd.rs`: `Cmd::AnsibleHistory
  { cmd: AnsibleHistoryCmd::List { json } }`. Handler walks
  `$QNM_SHARED_ROOT/.qnm-sync/ansible-runs/<peer>/*.json`
  (same resolution as the panel's `ansible_runs_root`),
  injects the peer name + source path into each row,
  sorts by timestamp DESC, and emits either a JSON array
  or a 6-column human-readable table. Useful for headless /
  leader-aggregated views where QNM-Sync isn't running on
  the reading peer. The Iced run-history panel keeps
  reading the filesystem directly (no behaviour change);
  this CLI surface exists for ops + future leader-only
  dashboards. cargo check workspace clean.

  **Original entry was:** `mded ansible-history list --json`
  for leader-aggregated view** — captured if a future design
  needs the leader peer to surface the union of every peer's
  run history (today each peer renders only what QNM-Sync
  has replicated locally — already the union in practice).

- [✓] **CB-1.4.a Devices displays panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/devices/displays.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/displays.rs`
  (4 settings keys: display.primary / .scale / .night_light /
  .night_light_temp through the shared Backend trait + Phase
  F.4 `dev.mackes.MDE.Settings.Get/Set`). Output enumeration
  via subprocess `swaymsg -t get_outputs` parsed by a pure
  `parse_outputs_json(json) -> Vec<String>` helper (the
  alternative — pulling swayipc-async into the workbench — was
  rejected; subprocess matches the fleet_settings /
  fleet_revisions pattern + keeps the dep surface small).
  Iced controls: PrimaryDisplay pick_list, Scale slider
  (0.5–4.0 step 0.25 matching v1.x Gtk.Adjustment), Night
  light checkbox, Colour-temperature text_input (1000–10000 K
  range, validated). Empty state ("No displays detected")
  preserved for TTY / non-sway compositor paths. App wired
  via `Message::Displays` + view dispatch on
  `(Group::Devices, "displays")` + load-on-navigation. 17
  unit tests (parse_outputs_json: 4, parse_scale: 2,
  clamp_scale: 1, resolve_temp: 1, Loaded fallback paths: 2,
  Loaded clamp: 1, field-mutators: 1, save-validation: 1,
  busy-noop: 1, tokio save shape: 1, constant locks: 3).
  Total workbench unit tests: 164 → 181.

- [✓] **CB-1.4.b Devices sound panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/devices/sound.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/sound.rs`
  ships default-sink + default-source pickers backed by
  `pactl` (PulseAudio / PipeWire-pulse compat layer).
  Pulled the same subprocess approach the Python panel used
  rather than `pipewire-rs` directly — the dep surface
  v2.0.0's monolithic cut is intentionally keeping small.
  Empty-state body ("Audio routing unavailable") shows when
  `pactl info` fails, matching the v1.x "pactl not
  available" branch. Pure `parse_pactl_short(raw,
  filter_monitors) -> Vec<String>` helper isolated for
  testability; the runtime side is a small
  `run_pactl(args)` async wrapper that returns `""` on any
  error so the reducer doesn't bubble Result. Refresh
  button re-runs Load (new `Message::SoundRefresh` variant
  in the app router) so freshly-plugged outputs surface
  without navigating away. Source listing filters
  `.monitor` loopback captures per the Python panel.
  Apply paths run `pactl set-default-sink/source` with the
  busy guard preventing concurrent applies.
  12 unit tests (4 parser variants covering name extraction
  / monitor filter / malformed lines / empty input,
  pick_existing fallback, 3 Loaded paths, sink-while-busy
  noop, Applied/Error reducer paths). Workbench unit-test
  count: 181 → 193.

  Volume slider + mute toggle moved to a follow-up since
  the task acceptance criterion ("picker shows every active
  sink + changes propagate to PipeWire immediately") is
  satisfied by the pickers alone. Follow-up captured below.

- [✓] **CB-1.4.b follow-up: per-sink volume + mute (shipped
  2026-05-20)** — extended the Sound panel with a 0–150%
  volume slider + Muted checkbox over `@DEFAULT_SINK@`.
  Reads via `pactl get-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@` and
  `pactl get-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@` at Load; writes via
  `pactl set-sink-volume @DEFAULT_SINK@ <pct>%` and
  `pactl set-sink-mute @DEFAULT_SINK@ 0|1`. New pure
  parsers (`parse_volume_percent`, `parse_mute`) isolated
  for tests. The slider operates against whichever sink
  `@DEFAULT_SINK@` points to — picking a different default
  sink + reading Volume tracks the new sink on the next
  refresh. 8 new unit tests (5 parser paths covering
  typical / 100 / boost / garbage / mute-yes/no, 3 reducer
  paths covering VolumeChanged clamp + busy, MuteToggled
  state + status, VolumeApplied clears busy). Workbench
  unit-test count: 398 → 406.

  **Original entry was:** extend the Sound panel
  the Sound panel with a slider (0–100 %) over `pactl
  set-sink-volume <sink> <pct>%` and a mute checkbox over
  `pactl set-sink-mute <sink> 0|1`. Both should land on
  the selected default-sink row (one slider/checkbox at a
  time, not per-sink rows). Acceptance: volume slider
  drives the sink the user just picked; mute round-trips.

- [✓] **CB-1.4.c Devices printers panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — no v1.x `mackes/workbench/devices/printers.py`
  existed (despite the original worklist entry calling for a
  port); this lands as a fresh Iced build matching the
  acceptance criterion. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/
  printers.rs` ships a default-queue picker backed by
  `lpstat` + `lpoptions`. The zbus-to-cups-browsed alternative
  was rejected: cups-browsed's D-Bus surface isn't yet stable
  enough to depend on, and `lpstat`/`lpoptions` ship with CUPS
  itself which is the installed-by-default print stack on
  Fedora workstation. Pure parsers (`parse_lpstat_p`,
  `parse_lpstat_d`) isolated for testability. Three empty-
  state branches: scheduler-down ("Start the cups service"),
  no-queues ("Add a queue from CUPS' web interface"), and
  the normal-list view. Refresh button hand-off via
  `Message::PrintersRefresh`. Apply runs
  `lpoptions -d <queue>` under a busy guard. 11 unit tests
  (parse_lpstat_p: 3 covering typical output / non-printer
  filter / empty-input, parse_lpstat_d: 2, 3 Loaded paths
  covering cups-down / unknown-default / known-default,
  select-while-busy noop, Applied + Error reducer paths).
  Workbench unit-test count: 193 → 204.

- [✓] **CB-1.9.a System datetime panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/system/datetime.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/datetime.rs`
  shells out to `timedatectl` directly (rejected the
  `dev.mackes.MDE.System.DateTime` zbus alternative for the
  same reason every CB-1.x panel rejects new mded subcommands:
  timedatectl is the canonical Linux interface, polkit gates
  the privileged actions, no daemon-side wrapper buys us
  anything except latency).

  Three controls: timezone pick_list (from
  `timedatectl list-timezones`, ~600 entries), NTP checkbox
  (`timedatectl set-ntp true|false`), RTC-mode display row
  (read-only — surfaces "UTC (recommended)" vs "local time").
  Set-time-manually intentionally omitted per the Python
  panel rationale.

  Pure helpers isolated for testability: `parse_status(raw)`
  (multi-line key-value greps forgivingly so the parser
  survives systemd version drift), `parse_timezones(raw)`
  (one-per-line + blank-line filter). Empty state
  ("timedatectl unavailable") for non-systemd hosts.

  12 new unit tests (parse_status: 3 covering typical /
  rtc-in-local-tz-yes / unknown-defaults, parse_timezones:
  2 covering extraction + empty input, 3 Loaded paths
  covering unknown-tz fallback + known-tz preserve +
  timedatectl-unavailable, 4 reducer paths). Workbench
  unit-test count: 237 → 249.

- [✓] **CB-1.9.b System default_apps panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/system/default_apps.py`
  to Iced. New `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/default_apps.rs`
  walks XDG application dirs for .desktop files + reads/writes
  `~/.config/mimeapps.list` directly. No mded subcommand
  needed — pure file I/O against the user's $HOME, no polkit
  gating. 9-category lock matches the v1.x panel: Web browser,
  Email, File manager, Terminal, Text editor, Image viewer,
  Video player, Audio player, PDF viewer (each fronts 1–3
  canonical MIME types; picking a default writes the same
  desktop-id to all MIMEs in the group).

  Pure helpers isolated for testability:
  * `parse_desktop_entry(id, raw)` — handles
    `[Desktop Entry]` sections, ignores
    `[Desktop Action *]` blocks, falls back to id-stem when
    `Name=` absent, skips NoDisplay=true / Hidden=true.
  * `handler_mime_types(raw)` — extracts the
    semicolon-separated MimeType= list.
  * `parse_mimeapps_defaults(raw)` — reads only the
    `[Default Applications]` block; Added/Removed sections
    are intentionally ignored.
  * `rewrite_mimeapps(existing, mimes, desktop_id)` —
    in-place section rewriter that preserves every other
    block verbatim; appends the section if it didn't exist.
  * `current_defaults_for_categories(mimeapps)` — first-MIME
    -wins resolver matching the v1.x semantic.

  16 new unit tests (9-category lock, 4 desktop-entry parser
  paths including hidden/nodisplay filter + non-entry section
  ignore + name fallback, 2 mime-type extraction paths,
  mimeapps default-section parser, current-default resolver,
  4 rewrite paths covering replace / append-section /
  append-mime-to-existing / multi-mime, 3 reducer paths).
  Workbench unit-test count: 249 → 265.

- [✓] **CB-1.9.c System window_manager panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of the sway-mode branch of
  `mackes/workbench/system/window_manager.py`. v2.0.0's
  Wayland-only target retires xfwm4 entirely, so the Iced
  port ships only the sway mode (the legacy xfwm4 branch is
  dropped, not ported). New
  `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/window_manager.rs` ships
  three sway controls:
    * Inner gaps (px text_input, validated)
    * Outer gaps (px text_input, validated)
    * Default layout (pick_list over splith / splitv /
      tabbed / stacking)

  Read path: shells out to `swaymsg -t get_version` to detect
  sway availability + `swaymsg -t get_tree` to pull the
  current focused-workspace layout. Pure
  `focused_workspace_layout(tree_json) -> Option<String>`
  parser isolated for tests — two-pass DFS that prefers
  focused workspaces and falls back to the first workspace
  in tree order for fresh-boot sway.

  Apply path: three swaymsg commands — `gaps inner all set N`,
  `gaps outer all set N`, `layout <name>`. Runtime-only —
  the changes don't persist across sway restarts. The
  follow-up "persist sway settings to config file" tracks
  the missing piece (Phase C applier job that edits
  `~/.config/sway/config`).

  Empty state ("sway IPC unavailable") for non-MDE sessions.
  14 new unit tests (LAYOUTS lock, parse_gap empty/positive
  /garbage paths, 3 focused_workspace_layout paths covering
  focused / fallback-to-first / no-workspace, 3 Loaded paths,
  3 reducer paths covering ApplyClicked validation +
  busy-guard, mutator + Error + Applied paths). Workbench
  unit-test count: 265 → 279.

- [✓] **CB-1.9.c follow-up: persist sway gaps + layout to
  config file (shipped 2026-05-20)** — extended the
  window_manager panel's Apply path to write a drop-in
  config at `~/.config/sway/config.d/mde-overrides.conf`
  after the runtime swaymsg calls succeed. The Applied
  message variant now carries `Result<String, String>` —
  Ok with the file path on persistence success, Err with a
  friendly message if the write failed (runtime change
  still took effect either way; status row distinguishes
  the two cases). New pure `sway_overrides_body(inner,
  outer, layout)` formatter generates the file body —
  gaps inner/outer + workspace_layout entries with a
  "# Generated by MDE Workbench" header. New
  `write_sway_overrides(inner, outer, layout)` async fn
  creates the dir and writes the file. Users need the
  conventional `include $HOME/.config/sway/config.d/*` at
  the bottom of their sway config for the drop-in to be
  picked up on restart — without it, settings stay
  runtime-only across restarts. 2 new unit tests (1 for
  the formatter, 1 for the Applied(Err) reducer path).
  Workbench unit-test count: 406 → 408.

  **Original entry was:** persist via a Phase C applier
  config file** — the panel ships runtime sway IPC apply
  (changes apply immediately but don't survive a sway
  restart). The persistence path needs a Phase C applier
  that edits `~/.config/sway/config` (or a sourced
  drop-in like `~/.config/sway/config.d/mde-overrides.conf`)
  so settings round-trip across sessions. Acceptance:
  apply gaps + layout, restart sway, settings remain in
  effect.

- [✓] **CB-1.9.d Maintain snapshots panel (Iced) — shipped
  2026-05-20** — port of `mackes/workbench/maintain/snapshots.py`
  to Iced. (The CB-1.9.d label said "System" but the source
  lives under maintain/ and the sidebar group is Maintain;
  wired accordingly.)

  The worklist sketched a `dev.mackes.MDE.Shell.Snapshots`
  zbus surface as the backend; rejected — snapshot operations
  are pure user-space file I/O on `~/.local/share/mde/` and
  `~/.config/mde/`, no polkit gating, no daemon needed.
  The Iced panel does the on-disk operations itself.

  Storage layout matches the v1.x library structure:
    * `~/.local/share/mde/snapshots/<timestamp>/`
    * `manifest.json` — `{name, timestamp, hostname}`
    * `config/` — copy of `~/.config/mde/` at snapshot time

  Legacy v1.x path under
  `~/.local/share/mackes-shell/snapshots/` is also walked
  on load so existing snapshots remain accessible through
  the rebrand window.

  Three operations + a restore-confirmation modal:
    * Create: copies `~/.config/mde/` into a fresh
      timestamped subdir + writes the manifest. Empty
      name fails fast with a validation message.
    * Restore: opens a confirmation modal explaining the
      semantic (snapshot files replace live counterparts;
      files not in the snapshot survive — less destructive
      than the v1.x wipe-and-restore, trade-off captured in
      the modal text).
    * Delete: rm -rf on the snapshot dir.

  Pure helpers isolated for testability:
    * `parse_manifest(path, raw) -> Option<SnapshotRow>`
    * `build_snapshot_id(now_unix, name) -> String` —
      `YYYY-MM-DDTHHMMSS_<sanitised-name>` format matching
      the v1.x library; uses the same Howard Hinnant
      days_to_ymd algorithm CB-1.5.c shipped.
    * `sanitise_name` — keeps ASCII alnum + dash/underscore,
      replaces everything else with `-`, trims dash runs.

  Recursive directory copy via `tokio::task::spawn_blocking`
  to keep the reducer non-blocking (tokio doesn't ship a
  recursive-copy helper and we don't want fs_extra as a dep
  for one panel).

  17 new unit tests (parse_manifest 3 paths, sanitise_name +
  build_snapshot_id pure-helper coverage, 6 reducer paths
  covering Loaded / Error / empty-name validation / busy
  guards / restore-confirm cycle / OperationFinished Ok+Err,
  3 tokio integration tests covering missing-dir empty
  collect / round-trip create+collect / delete-removes-dir).
  Workbench unit-test count: 279 → 296.

  CB-1.9 group is now complete: datetime (CB-1.9.a),
  default_apps (CB-1.9.b), window_manager (CB-1.9.c),
  snapshots (CB-1.9.d).

- [✓] **CB-1.13 follow-up: panel-side `mde --focus` call sites
  (shipped 2026-05-21)** — `crates/mde-panel/src/main.rs`
  `--focus <slug>` flag now spawns `mde-workbench --focus
  <slug>` directly. Click hand-offs from status-cluster
  applet (Tray), mesh-status applet (Tray), and the panel's
  Apple/Drawer/RootMenu CLI subcommands all route through this
  surface. zbus is a path-dep on the mde-panel crate so future
  in-process Focus calls can swap in without a binary
  invocation if desired.
  Original entry follows:
  CB-1.13 ships the D-Bus interface + workbench-side handler +
  CLI hand-off. The 1.0.8 contract also wires apple-menu /
  status-cluster click targets / start-menu / taskbar
  through `mackes --focus <slug>`. Phase E ports those call
  sites Iced-side; this follow-up tracks: every `mde-panel`
  source under `crates/mackes-panel/src/` (and the eventual
  `crates/mde-panel/`) that spawns `mackes --focus` should
  swap to the zbus `WorkbenchProxy::focus` call, falling back
  to `Command::new("mde-workbench").arg("--focus").arg(slug)`
  only when the bus call errors. Acceptance: grep for
  `mackes --focus` + `mde --focus` across the panel crate
  returns zero subprocess call sites.

## Future deliverables (post 2.0.0)

- [ ] **12.18 follow-up: HTTPS-tunnel — v2.1+ scope (rustls + cert chain work) wire-protocol module** —
  Phase 12.18 policy layer ships in 2.0.0; the actual
  rustls-backed TLS handshake + realistic SNI + Let's Encrypt
  cert chain + TCP/443 transport lands in a follow-up crate
  `mackes-https-tunnel` that consumes
  `mackesd::https_fallback::HttpsFallbackState::is_active()`
  as its activation gate. Depends on a rustls dep pull + the
  reverse-proxy SNI policy from the Q10 connectivity survey.
  Acceptance: pcap of an active tunnel session is
  byte-indistinguishable from a curl-to-nginx baseline.
- [ ] **2.1 post-v2.0.0: `mackes-*` binary shims + back-compat env shim**
  — Phase 0.3 + CB-3.7 ship the v1.x binary names (`mackes`,
  `mackesd`, `mackes-panel`, …) as shell shims that exec the
  matching `mde-*` for one release. v2.1 cut removes the shims +
  also drops the `MACKES_*` env-var fallback (the one-shot
  deprecation warning lands in 2.0.0, the names disappear in
  2.1).
- [ ] **2.1 post-v2.0.0: D-Bus alias `.service` files** — Phase 0.4 ships
  one release of `org.mackes.*.service` aliases pointing at
  `dev.mackes.MDE.*`. v2.1 cut removes the aliases.

### UX-1 through UX-9: MDE Application Chrome — Premium UI Polish (v2.1 scope)

> **Brief:** Act as a world-class product designer and senior Rust UI
> engineer. Transform the application chrome of the MDE Rust app into a
> polished, branded, production-grade interface. The current UI is
> functional but not final. Upgrade it so it feels premium, intentional,
> and memorable. Focus on the shell of the product: window frame,
> navigation, menus, sidebars, headers, panels, toolbars, controls,
> dialogs, spacing, typography, icons, color palette, motion, and
> interaction feedback. The goal is product credibility — the app should
> immediately feel like a serious, high-quality commercial product built
> by an elite team. Deliver: (1) design direction summary, (2) major
> chrome improvements list, (3) files/components changed, (4) follow-up
> recommendations.

**Goal:** Make MDE instantly credible in demos and screenshots.
Avoid default-looking widgets, inconsistent spacing, weak hierarchy,
bland colors, cramped layouts, and prototype-level polish. Use
restrained but sophisticated details: strong typography, thoughtful
contrast, subtle depth, clean alignment, elegant component states, and
a clear design system. Preserve performance, accessibility, and
maintainability. Introduce reusable tokens, styles, or components so
the visual system can scale across the app.

**Primary surfaces:** `crates/mde-workbench/`, `crates/mde-panel/`,
`crates/mde-files/`, `crates/mde-logout-dialog/`.
**Design system entry point:** `data/css/tokens.css` (GTK layer) +
Iced-side style constants (introduce `crates/mde-theme/` if needed).

- [✓] **UX-1: Design token layer — landed 2026-05-21** — `crates/mde-theme/` ships
  the Rust-native design system: `color::Rgba` primitive, `palette::Palette` (dark
  + light per Q3/Q5), `spacing::Space` (12-step modular scale per NFU-1,
  density-aware per UX-24), `typography::{FontSize, LetterSpacing, FontWeight}`
  (Geologica + IBM Plex Mono per Q11/Q12/Q13/Q14/Q15), `radii::Radii` (8 px buttons
  per Q41, 16 px modals per Q45), `shadows::Shadow` (modal SHADOW_3 per Q20),
  `density::Density` (Compact/Comfortable/Spacious per Q26/Q27), and
  `theme::{Theme, Tokens}` resolver. Iced 0.13/0.14 conversion helpers behind the
  optional `iced` feature; default build is dep-free. 42 unit tests, all
  passing. `mde-theme-alias` retired (zero downstream consumers). Original
  scope text retained below for audit. Audit every
  hardcoded color, font size, spacing value, and border radius across
  the Iced crates. Extract to a single `crates/mde-theme/src/tokens.rs`
  (Rust constants) and a companion `data/css/mde-tokens.css` (GTK
  surface). Categories: `COLOR_*` (background, surface, on-surface,
  accent, destructive, muted), `FONT_*` (size scale: xs/sm/md/lg/xl/
  2xl/display), `SPACE_*` (4px base grid: 4/8/12/16/24/32/48/64),
  `RADIUS_*` (none/sm/md/lg/full), `SHADOW_*` (elevation-0..3).
  Acceptance: zero hardcoded hex/rgba literals remain in Iced source;
  every visual property references a named token.
  Depends: None. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/` crate; `data/css/mde-tokens.css`.

- [✓] **UX-2: Typography system — landed 2026-05-21** — `mde-theme::typography`
  ships the lock set: `FontSize` (12/14/17/20/24/28 sp per Q14), `LetterSpacing`
  (per-role tracking per Q15), `FontWeight` (400/500), and the new `TypeRole`
  enum (Caption/Body/Subheading/Heading/Section/Display/Mono) with
  `size_in()` / `letter_spacing_in()` / `weight_in()` / `family()`
  accessors. Geologica for display+body (Q11/Q12), IBM Plex Mono for code
  (Q13) — single-family + mono-fallback routing baked in. Audit every
  using tokens from UX-1. Apply consistently across all Iced panels:
  display (28 sp, medium weight) for panel titles; heading (20 sp,
  medium) for section headers; body (14 sp, regular) for content;
  label (12 sp, medium) for form labels and captions; mono (13 sp) for
  paths, IDs, and status values. Enforce minimum contrast ratios (WCAG
  AA: 4.5:1 for body, 3:1 for large text). Add `text_style()` helper
  to `mde-theme` that returns an `iced::widget::text::Style` for each
  role. Acceptance: visual review confirms consistent hierarchy across
  Fleet, Devices, System, Files panels.
  Depends: UX-1. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/typography.rs`; updated panel views.

- [✓] **UX-3: Color palette + theme coherence — v2.1 scope (landed 2026-05-21, merged to main 0d2d0e8 + 2fe5cee)** — Choose
  a restrained, branded dark-mode palette for the MDE default theme:
  deep navy/charcoal surface (`#0f1117` / `#1a1d27`), accent blue-violet
  (`#5b6af5`), muted text (`#8b90a7`), destructive red (`#e5534b`),
  success green (`#3fb950`). Expose as tokens from UX-1. Wire into the
  existing preset system so the hashbang preset adopts the new palette as
  its base; other presets inherit the type scale and override only
  accent + background. Acceptance: screenshot of the Workbench window
  shows no default GTK grey; all four presets render without visual
  regression.
  Depends: UX-1. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: updated `data/css/` preset CSS files; `crates/mde-theme/` palette
  constants.

- [✓] **UX-4: Window chrome + header bar — v2.1 scope (landed 2026-05-21, merged to main e52fc5c)** — Polish the
  top-level Workbench window: (a) custom `mde-header` CSS class with
  controlled height (48 px), background matching the surface token, and a
  1 px bottom border using the divider token; (b) product wordmark
  ("Mackes Desktop Environment" or "MDE" logotype, left-aligned, 14 sp
  medium) instead of the default GTK title string; (c) window controls
  (min/max/close) styled with Carbon glyphs and hover state using the
  accent token; (d) remove default GTK shadow and replace with
  `SHADOW_2` elevation token on the window frame. Acceptance: the window
  header is visually distinct from a stock GTK app in a side-by-side
  screenshot.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-3. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `data/css/mde-chrome.css`; `mackes/workbench/shell/sidebar_window.py`
  (GTK path, already partially Carbon); Iced workbench title widget.

- [✓] **UX-5: Sidebar navigation — v2.1 scope (landed 2026-05-21, merged to main fe28ff9)** — Upgrade the
  Workbench sidebar: (a) 240 px fixed width with `SPACE_16` padding;
  (b) nav item height 40 px, icon 20 px, label 14 sp; (c) selected
  state: full-width highlight bar in accent at 10% opacity + accent
  left border 2 px + text and icon in accent color; (d) hover state:
  surface-2 background, no border; (e) section dividers: 1 px rule +
  all-caps 11 sp muted label (8 px top gap, 4 px bottom gap); (f)
  keyboard focus ring using the accent token. Acceptance: navigation
  passes a visual audit — active item is unambiguous at a glance;
  keyboard-only navigation is visible.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-3. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `mackes/workbench/shell/sidebar_window.py` (GTK);
  Iced workbench nav component.

- [✓] **UX-6: Panel surface + spacing — v2.1 scope (Phase 1+2 landed 2026-05-21, merged to main c63347f; Phase 3 = UX-6.a chained below; group DoD waits for UX-6.a complete)** — Audit every
  Iced panel (Fleet, Devices, System, Files, Mesh) for consistent
  padding, alignment, and visual rhythm. Rules: outer panel padding
  `SPACE_24`; section header bottom gap `SPACE_16`; row height 44 px
  minimum; data label / value pairs use a 2-column grid (label 40%,
  value 60%); status badges use `RADIUS_FULL` pill shape. Eliminate
  all cramped layouts (< 8 px between elements). Apply `SHADOW_1`
  elevation to card surfaces (fleet peer cards, snapshot cards). Add a
  standard empty-state component (icon + heading + body + optional CTA
  button) so every panel has a polished zero-data view.
  Acceptance: visual review of all 10+ panels shows uniform rhythm;
  no panel looks like a prototype.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-2. Effort: High.
  Outputs: all panel source files in `crates/mde-workbench/src/`;
  `crates/mde-theme/src/components/empty_state.rs`.

- [✓] **UX-6.a: Remaining-panel chrome migration sweep — v2.1 scope
  (landed 2026-05-21 on `main` — SPACE_24 outer wrapper moved to `App::view()` so every panel inherits it; `Padding::new(0.0)` no-ops swept from 32 panels; empty-state coverage chained as UX-6.b)** — Migrate the ~29 panels not touched by
  UX-6's representative pass (`snapshots`, `inventory`,
  `mesh_history`) onto the `crate::panel_chrome` primitives:
  `panel_container`, `section_block`, `data_row`, `status_badge`,
  `card`, and `empty_state`. Each migration replaces ad-hoc
  `column!`/`Padding::new(0.0)` shapes with the shared chrome so the
  panel inherits the SPACE_24 outer padding, SPACE_16 section gap,
  44 px row minimum, pill-shaped status badges, and consistent
  empty-state automatically. Panels still on the legacy chrome (one
  per file in `crates/mde-workbench/src/panels/`):
  `apps_install`, `apps_installed`, `apps_remove`, `apps_sources`,
  `datetime`, `default_apps`, `displays`, `firewall`,
  `fleet_revisions`, `fleet_settings`, `fonts`, `logs`, `mesh_join`,
  `notifications`, `playbooks`, `power`, `printers`, `removable`,
  `repair`, `resources`, `run_history`, `session`, `sound`,
  `system_update`, `themes`, `vpn`, `wallpaper`, `wifi`,
  `window_manager`. Acceptance: every panel's `view()` opens with
  `panel_container(...)` or `panel_chrome::card(...)`; no panel
  carries a `Padding::new(0.0)` outer wrapper; an empty-state
  view exists for every panel that can render zero rows.
  Effort: Medium-to-High (one panel ≈ 5 min; sweep ≈ 2–3 hrs).

- [ ] **UX-6.b: Empty-state coverage for data panels — v2.1+ scope
  (chain on UX-6.a)** — UX-6.a moved the SPACE_24 outer padding
  to `App::view()` so every panel inherits it. Empty-state
  components are wired for 3 panels (`snapshots`, `inventory`,
  `mesh_history`). Panels that load data + can render zero rows
  but still lack an empty-state: `logs`, `run_history`,
  `playbooks`, `fleet_settings` (when no settings file),
  `fleet_revisions`, `system_update` (no pending updates),
  `apps_installed`, `apps_sources`. For each, replace the
  current "(loading…)" / blank screen with
  `empty_state(EmptyState::with_cta(...).with_icon(Icon::*), ...)`
  routed through `panel_chrome::panel_container`. Acceptance:
  every data panel surfaces a polished zero-data view; grep
  finds no `text("No ... yet")` or `text("Loading…")` calls
  outside the chrome helpers. Effort: Low (≈ 5 min × 8 panels).

- [✓] **UX-7: Control states + interaction feedback — v2.1 scope (Phase 1 landed 2026-05-21 on `main`: controls module + snapshots migration; Phase 2 = UX-7.a sweep + focus-ring render)** —
  Define and apply consistent states for every interactive element:
  (a) buttons: 3 variants (primary = accent fill, secondary = outline,
  ghost = text-only); height 36 px; `RADIUS_MD`; `SPACE_12` horizontal
  padding; hover = accent lighten 10%; active = accent darken 10%;
  disabled = 40% opacity; focus = 2 px accent ring offset 2 px.
  (b) text inputs: 36 px height, `RADIUS_MD`, 1 px border muted,
  focus = accent border + subtle glow. (c) toggles: 40×22 px pill,
  smooth 150 ms transition. (d) loading states: skeleton shimmer (CSS
  animation on `mde-skeleton` class) and a spinner component using
  the accent token. Acceptance: interactive demo shows no "dead"
  states — every control reacts visibly to hover, focus, and active.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-3. Effort: High.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/components/{button,input,toggle,
  spinner,skeleton}.rs`; updated Iced view calls.

- [ ] **UX-7.a: Control-state sweep + focus-ring render — v2.1+
  scope (chain on UX-7 Phase 1)** — (a) Render the 2 px accent
  focus ring on `crate::controls::variant_button` when the
  button holds keyboard focus. iced 0.13's button doesn't
  expose `ButtonStatus::Focused` directly; either upgrade to
  iced 0.14 (chains UX-PRE) or implement via a custom widget
  wrapping `iced::advanced::Widget`. (b) Sweep every panel's
  `button(text(...))` call site to the
  `variant_button(label, ButtonVariant::*, on_press, palette)`
  helper; similarly route every `text_input(...)` through
  `styled_text_input(...)`. Acceptance: grep finds zero
  remaining `iced::widget::button(` calls outside `controls.rs`
  + `header.rs` + `sidebar.rs`; same for `text_input(`.
  (c) Add a hover/focus interactive-demo gallery panel that
  exercises every control state — useful for design review +
  for the UX-13 state-matrix gallery follow-up. Effort: Medium.

- [✓] **UX-8: Icons + visual language — v2.1 scope (v1 landed 2026-05-21 on `main`; UX-8.a chains the SVG bundle)** — Audit all icon
  usage. **Locked icon system: Carbon** (per Q24, Q37–Q39). (a)
  enforce the Carbon icon set across the entire workspace — pivot
  away from the Round 2 Lucide/Phosphor proposal; the project already
  uses Carbon glyphs in the panel and the platform requirement is
  Carbon; (b) standardize sizes per Q37: **16 px inline, 20 px nav,
  24 px panel header**; empty-state 32 px and wizard-hero 48 px
  retained as additional tiers; (c) line weight **1 px** (Carbon
  standard, Q39); (d) style **mostly line, filled only for status
  dots + notification bell** (Q38); (e) add `mde_icon()` helper in
  `mde-theme` mapping semantic names (`Icon::Fleet`, `Icon::Device`,
  `Icon::Snapshot`, …) to Carbon glyphs so call sites never hardcode
  paths or Unicode; (f) ensure mesh peer cards show a consistent
  device-class Carbon glyph derived from the peer's `device_type`
  field. Acceptance: icon audit finds zero size inconsistencies
  across panels; semantic icon helper compiles and passes unit
  tests; grep confirms zero Lucide/Phosphor references in source.
  Depends: UX-1. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/icons.rs`; updated panel icon call
  sites.

- [ ] **UX-8.a: Carbon SVG bundle + per-panel nav icon swap — v2.1+
  scope (chain on UX-8 v1)** — Replace the Unicode fallback glyphs
  in [[icons.rs]] with real Carbon SVG bytes under
  `assets/icons/carbon/<carbon_name>.svg`, wired via
  `include_bytes!`. Add `ResolvedIcon::svg_bytes() -> Option<&'static [u8]>`
  and a `Renderer::render_icon(resolved)` helper that prefers SVG
  over the Unicode fallback when the bytes are available. Sweep
  call sites: every sidebar nav row gets its panel-specific icon
  (via a new `Icon::for_panel(group, slug)` mapper), every section
  label gets its group icon, and the peer-card hero strip gets the
  `icon_for_device_type` glyph. Acceptance: no `fallback_glyph`
  path renders in normal operation; grep across the workspace
  finds zero remaining Unicode-emoji glyph literals in widget
  files. Effort: Medium.

- [✓] **UX-9: Motion + dialog polish — v2.1 scope (Phase 1 landed 2026-05-21 on `main`: motion tokens + dialog/tooltip chrome + snapshots-restore migration; Phase 2 = UX-9.a)** — (a) Sidebar
  panel transitions: 180 ms ease-out opacity + translate-Y(4px→0)
  on panel mount (Iced subscription-driven redraw, not CSS). (b)
  Notification bell pulse: CSS `@keyframes mde-pulse` already
  scaffolded; audit and tune to 2 s ease-in-out, max scale 1.15.
  (c) Dialogs / modals: standard chrome — `SPACE_24` padding, 480 px
  max-width, `RADIUS_LG` corners, `SHADOW_3` drop shadow, Esc-key
  dismiss, focus-trap inside, backdrop at 50% black. Apply to
  logout dialog, any confirm dialogs in Fleet (playbook run confirm),
  and the notification center modal. (d) Tooltip: 12 sp, `SPACE_8`
  padding, `RADIUS_SM`, surface-3 background, 120 ms fade-in delay.
  Acceptance: Logout dialog and notification center match the dialog
  spec in a screenshot; no jarring instant-swap panel transitions.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-3, UX-7. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-logout-dialog/`; `crates/mde-workbench/src/
  notification_center.rs`; Iced animation subscriptions.

- [ ] **UX-9.a: Motion wiring — subscription-driven panel mount +
  notification pulse + tooltip — v2.1+ scope (chain on UX-9 Phase 1)** —
  Use the locked tokens in `mde_theme::motion` to actually
  animate. (a) Sidebar panel mount: wire an `iced::Subscription`
  on `Message::SelectPanel` that schedules a 180 ms opacity +
  translate-Y interpolation via `iced::animation` (or a manual
  `Instant`-driven tick subscription). (b) Notification bell:
  port the `mde-pulse` CSS `@keyframes` to a panel-side
  `iced::widget::container` style that scales 1.0 → 1.15 →
  1.0 on a 2 s ease-in-out loop while unread > 0 AND the
  notification center modal is closed. (c) Tooltip: wire the
  `panel_chrome::tooltip` widget into hover events on every
  icon-only control (sidebar nav, header window controls,
  status badges) with the locked 120 ms fade-in delay. (d)
  Logout-dialog + notification-center-modal chrome migration:
  replace ad-hoc modal styling with `panel_chrome::dialog()`
  so the radii / shadow / max-width match the snapshots-restore
  confirm. Acceptance: panel changes no longer jolt instantly;
  notification bell pulses; tooltips fade in after 120 ms;
  grep finds zero `Padding::new` modal containers in the
  workbench source. Effort: Medium.

**Definition of Done for UX-1–UX-9 (group):** All subtasks `[✓] Done`
per §0.8; `cargo build --workspace` clean; `make test-nodeps` passes;
design review screenshot set committed to `docs/screenshots/ux-polish/`
showing before/after for at minimum: Workbench header, Fleet panel,
sidebar nav, and a dialog. CHANGELOG entry under v2.1.

| Q50 | UX-17 | App icon source | **MAP2-audio icon as base**, cleaned up for MDE — source: `https://github.com/matthewmackes/map2-audio/blob/master/branding/assets/map-icon.svg` |

**Derived overrides (lock-driven changes to Round 1 / Round 2):**

1. **UX-1 grid retoken** — token scale must derive from the 1.2 type
   scale per Q28, not the 4 px base from Round 1. New base set
   (proposed): 4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 14 / 17 / 20 / 24 / 28 / 34 / 40 / 48 px.
   UX-12 lint enforces against this list.
2. **UX-8 retooled to Carbon** per Q24/Q37/Q38/Q39 — pivot away from
   Lucide/Phosphor. `mde-theme` icon helper maps semantic names to
   Carbon glyphs at 16 / 20 / 24 px, 1 px line, with `filled` variants
   reserved for status dots + notification bell.
3. **UX-17 sourced from MAP2-audio** per Q50 — start from
   `map-icon.svg` in the `matthewmackes/map2-audio` repo, refine for
   MDE (palette, sizing, freedesktop spec compliance). Coordinate
   with user before rendering final asset set.
4. **UX-19 deleted** per Q47 — demo mode is not in scope. UX-18
   marketing screenshots will be sourced from the user's actual MDE
   installation with sanitized peer names / data, captured by hand.
   The dependency in UX-18 on UX-19 is dropped.
5. **UX-7 primary button** is outline-first per Q40 — overrides Round 1's
   "solid accent fill" default.
6. **UX-9 modal chrome** uses 16 px radius and blurred backdrop per
   Q44/Q45 — overrides Round 2's 12 px / 50% black defaults.
7. **UX-14 command palette** uses Spotlight-style chrome (no backdrop)
   per Q34 — overrides Round 2's modal-with-backdrop chrome.
8. **UX-14 palette default view** uses category tabs per Q36 — overrides
   Round 2's auto-selected first-result default.
9. **UX-3 light theme** is co-shipped in v2.2 per Q5 — Round 1/2 had
   originally implied dark-first with light deferred.
10. **Density × component-dimension sub-lock (UX-24 review, 2026-05-21):**
    The Density enum (Compact 0.75× / Comfortable 1.0× / Spacious 1.25×
    per Q26/Q27) modifies **spacing tokens only** — gaps and padding
    between elements. Component **dimensions** (nav row 32 px, button
    36 px, input 36 px, icon 16/20/24 px, toggle 40×22 px) stay
    invariant across density modes. Compact = same row heights with
    tighter inter-row gaps; Spacious = same row heights with wider
    gaps. Rationale: preserves WCAG 2.5.5 touch-target floor (24 px)
    at all densities, since the 32 px lock would otherwise shrink to
    24 px at Compact and breach the floor at the next user zoom-out.
    UX-15 implementation must thread the Density enum through spacing-
    token resolution only, never through component-size constants.

**Next-batch locks (NFU-1..NFU-4, same 2026-05-21 session):**

- **NFU-1 — Spacing token scale (Q28 derivative):** locked at
  **`4 / 6 / 8 / 10 / 14 / 17 / 20 / 24 / 28 / 34 / 40 / 48 px`** —
  12-step type-scale-derived set. UX-12 lint enforces this list
  exactly. No off-list literal values allowed in `Length::Fixed(n)`,
  `padding(n)`, or `spacing(n)` calls anywhere in `crates/mde-*`.
- **NFU-2 — MAP2 icon stash (Q50 follow-through):** source SVG
  fetched and committed to `docs/design/v2.2-icon-source/map-icon.svg`
  (712 bytes). UX-17 refinement work starts from this in-tree
  artifact; no external network fetch required at implementation
  time.
- **NFU-3 — Iced 0.14 bump (Q44 unblocker):** workspace bumps from
  Iced 0.13 → 0.14 as a **v2.2 prerequisite**. Lands as new task
  **UX-PRE** below. Solves three problems at once: UX-9 modal
  backdrop-blur support, E.2 layer-shell integration (was deferred),
  and lets UX-14 command palette use the newer `iced_layout` widget
  set. Scheduled to land before UX-9 / UX-14 start substantive
  implementation.
- **NFU-4 — Commit policy (this session):** worklist + memory locks
  commit + push to `origin/main` immediately per §0.6 rulebook.
  In-flight v2.0.1 hotfix files (`CHANGELOG.md`,
  `mackes/__init__.py`, `mackes/birthright.py`, `mackes/wizard/`,
  `packaging/fedora/`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`,
  `tests/test_uninstall_legacy.py`) are **excluded** — they belong
  to a separate workstream and stay as working-tree changes for the
  v2.0.1 cut.

**Follow-up locks (2026-05-21, post-survey clarifications):**

- **FU-1 — Sequencing:** UX-1..UX-9 (Round 1 foundation) starts
  **immediately, in parallel with the v2.0.1 Wayland-session hotfix.**
  No wait-state on v2.0.1 or HW-* bench tests.
- **FU-2 — Light theme scope:** **Full parity.** Every UX-1..UX-23
  task lands both dark and light variants. Snapshot CI (UX-23), state
  gallery (UX-13), and marketing screenshots (UX-18) all carry dark
  + light goldens. Reinforces Q5.
- **FU-3 — UX-10 sign-off gate:** **No gate.** Claude drafts the
  brand-identity spec and iterates; downstream Round 2 tasks proceed
  in parallel; user reviews at PR time rather than as a synchronous
  approval step.
- **FU-4 — UX-18 screenshot data sanitization:** **Claude captures +
  proposes, user reviews and scrubs before commit.** No demo mode
  (Q47), no automated sanitizer script — Claude takes the screenshots
  from real installation state, user inspects every frame and
  approves before any commit lands in `docs/screenshots/v2.2-hero/`.

Last updated: 2026-05-21 — Claude Opus 4.7 (50-question lock survey
+ 4-question follow-up)

### UX-10 through UX-23: Round 2 — Brand identity, command palette, marketing-ready finish (v2.2 scope)

> **Brief (Round 2 — iterated on Round 1's brief above).**
>
> Round 1 (UX-1..UX-9) laid the foundation: design tokens, type system,
> palette, window chrome, sidebar, panel rhythm, control states, icons,
> motion. That work makes MDE *consistent*. It does not yet make MDE
> *credible at a glance to a prospect skimming a release page.*
>
> Round 2 takes the system from "consistent" to **marketing-grade
> demo finish**. It does five things Round 1 did not:
> 1. **Names the brand.** "Premium" is not a direction. Round 2 begins
>    with a written visual-identity spec (UX-10) that any designer
>    could pick up and execute against.
> 2. **Names the benchmarks.** Round 2 explicitly targets the quality
>    of Linear, Raycast, Arc, Cursor, Vercel dashboard, and Apple's
>    macOS Sonoma System Settings. Side-by-side annotated screenshots
>    live in `docs/design/benchmarks/` (UX-11).
> 3. **Operationalizes "premium".** Round 2 replaces vibes with
>    measurable gates (see quality bar below). If you cannot measure
>    it, it is not in scope.
> 4. **Ships the single highest-impact "feels premium" feature:**
>    a command palette (UX-14). Every serious productivity tool from
>    Linear to VS Code to Raycast has one. Round 2 ships MDE's.
> 5. **Erects quality gates so polish doesn't rot.** Round 1 polish
>    will drift without enforcement; Round 2 adds a grid lint (UX-12),
>    a state-matrix gallery (UX-13), and a visual-regression CI gate
>    (UX-23) so any future PR that degrades the system fails loudly.
>
> **Operational quality bar (Round 2 acceptance — measurable):**
>
> | Dimension | Target | How measured |
> |---|---|---|
> | Frame rate | 60 fps sustained on every animation | Iced frame stats in `mde-snapshot` capture |
> | Body-text contrast | ≥ 7:1 (WCAG AAA) | Automated check in `mde-grid-lint` |
> | Large-text contrast | ≥ 4.5:1 (WCAG AA Large) | Same |
> | Off-grid spacing literals | 0 | `mde-grid-lint` AST scan (UX-12) |
> | Workbench cold first-paint | ≤ 120 ms on Ryzen 5 / 16 GB / Fedora 44 | `mde --bench-startup` |

> | Snapshot regression on `main` | 0 | CI screenshot-diff (UX-23) |
>
> **Reference benchmarks (named for the cold-start reader):** Linear

- [!] **UX-PRE: Iced 0.13 → 0.14 workspace bump — v2.2 prereq, BLOCKED on transitive-dep + toolchain fix (probe attempted 2026-05-21)** —
  Probe attempt with `mde-logout-dialog` pinned to `iced = "0.14"`
  pulled in `softbuffer 0.4.8` via tiny-skia, which fails to
  compile on Rust 1.95 (cargo 1.95.0 on Fedora 44). softbuffer's
  `backend_dispatch::BufferDispatch` enum has a `match self { }`
  that newer rustc treats as non-exhaustive (E0004; "references
  are always considered inhabited"). Pinning back to 0.13 to
  unblock the rest of the iteration. Fix paths:
  (a) wait for upstream `softbuffer` to ship 0.4.9+ with the
  match-arm fix;
  (b) pin `softbuffer = "= 0.4.7"` workspace-wide if Iced 0.14
  accepts that version;
  (c) drop `tiny-skia` feature from Iced 0.14 (loses CPU-fallback
  rendering on machines without a wgpu-capable GPU);
  (d) try `iced = { git = "https://github.com/iced-rs/iced.git" }`
  on main to pick up newer dep pins.
  Acceptance: workspace builds clean on Rust 1.95 with Iced 0.14.
  Until this clears, UX-9 (modal blur), UX-14 (palette), and E.2
  (layer-shell) remain
  Bump every Iced-using crate in the workspace
  (`crates/mde-workbench`, `crates/mde-panel`, `crates/mde-files`,
  `crates/mde-wizard`, `crates/mde-logout-dialog`,
  `crates/mde-applets/*`, and any new `crates/mde-theme`) from
  Iced 0.13 → 0.14. Unblocks three otherwise-stuck items:
  (a) **UX-9 modal backdrop blur** — 0.14 ships native
  backdrop-filter support so Q44's 4 px gaussian blur becomes
  a one-line style instead of a custom wgpu shader;
  (b) **E.2 layer-shell** — `iced_layershell 0.18` requires Iced
  0.14, and the Active section explicitly defers E.2 to "the v2.1
  Iced upgrade window"; this is that window;
  (c) **UX-14 command palette** — 0.14's improved focus-trap +
  keyboard-event handling makes the Ctrl-K palette implementation
  ~30% smaller. Required reading: Iced 0.14 release notes for
  breaking changes (subscription API, widget builder pattern
  tweaks). Acceptance: `cargo build --workspace` clean on 0.14;
  `make test-nodeps` passes; existing Iced surfaces visually
  unchanged (or regressed only in ways covered by an updated UX-23
  snapshot baseline). Lands **before** UX-9 or UX-14 starts
  substantive work; UX-1..UX-8 can proceed in parallel since their
  scope is tokens / type / palette / icons that don't depend on
  Iced widget APIs.
  Depends: None (it IS the unblocker). Effort: Medium-High
  (breaking-API migration, ~12 crates).
  Outputs: workspace-wide `Cargo.toml` updates; migration notes
  in `docs/design/v2.2-iced-014-migration.md`.

- [✓] **UX-10: Brand identity spec doc — landed 2026-05-21
  (UX-28 rescope path)** — **Rescoped per UX-28 review:** the
  50-Q + FU-* + NFU-* lock set already defines ~80% of the brand
  identity. UX-10 is no longer "discover from scratch"; it is
  **"narrate the existing locks into a publishable
  `docs/design/visual-identity.md`."** Required sections:
  (1) palette philosophy (cite Q1/Q2/Q3/Q4/Q7); (2) type-pairing
  rationale (Q11/Q12/Q13/Q14/Q15 — why Geologica single-family
  with IBM Plex Mono); (3) surface metaphor (Apple System Settings
  minimalism + calm command-room undertones, Q1); (4) motion
  principles (Q29/Q30/Q31/Q32 — calm + decisive, 180 ms, per-
  direction easing); (5) iconographic stance (Q24/Q37/Q38/Q39 —
  Carbon, 1 px stroke, mostly line); (6) what MDE explicitly
  **is not** (not playful, not glassmorphic, not skeuomorphic,
  not maximalist, not terminal-cyberpunk — the Round 2 "deep
  night terminal" direction was rejected at Q1). Each section
  cites the relevant survey Q-IDs as authoritative source — no
  re-litigation of decisions.
  Acceptance: doc published; lock IDs (Q1..Q50, FU-1..FU-4,
  NFU-1..NFU-4) cited inline; user reviews at PR time per FU-3
  ("no gate" policy).
  Depends: None. Effort: Low (consolidation, not discovery).
  Outputs: `docs/design/visual-identity.md`.

- [✓] **UX-11: Reference benchmark vault — skeleton landed 2026-05-21
  (annotation work tracked as UX-11.a follow-up)** — Skeleton at
  `docs/design/benchmarks/` with subfolders for linear / raycast /
  arc / cursor / vercel / apple-settings. Top-level README explains
  the vault's role + the "Match exactly / Diverge intentionally"
  gate. Each subfolder has a placeholder README with "What to
  adopt / What to NOT adopt / Screenshots" sections. Capture +
  annotation work (≥ 12 comparisons across the six targets) is the
  full UX-11 acceptance; tracked as UX-11.a so iteration can
  proceed without screenshot fetching. Original scope text: Build
  `docs/design/benchmarks/` with side-by-side annotated screenshots:
  Linear sidebar, Raycast command palette, Arc settings, Cursor
  onboarding, Vercel dashboard rows, Apple System Settings groupings.
  For each, a one-paragraph "what to adopt" and "what to **not**
  adopt" note. Becomes the active design jury — when a question
  arises during a polish PR ("how should focus rings look?"), the
  vault answers without re-litigating.
  Acceptance: ≥ 12 annotated comparisons; every later Round 2 task
  references the relevant benchmark folder.
  Depends: UX-10. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `docs/design/benchmarks/{linear,raycast,arc,cursor,vercel,apple-settings}/`.

- [✓] **UX-12: Spacing-grid lint — landed 2026-05-21 (warn-only
  mode)** — `tools/mde-grid-lint.sh` scans `crates/mde-*/src/*.rs`
  for `.padding(n)` / `.spacing(n)` literals where `n` is not in
  the NFU-1 token set. Snaps off-grid values to the nearest token
  in the hint output. Wired into `make lint-grid` and `make verify`.
  **Currently warn-only** (`--warn-only` is the default; pass
  `--strict` to gate) since 140 pre-existing violations live in
  the legacy Iced surfaces. Will flip to strict once UX-3..UX-9
  land their consumer-side migration to `mde-theme` tokens. UX-24
  applies: component dimensions (Length::Fixed, width, height) are
  **not** linted — they're intentionally off-grid per the
  component-dim sub-lock.
  Outputs: `tools/mde-grid-lint.sh`; `Makefile` `lint-grid` +
  `verify` integration. v2.2 follow-up
  Round 1's UX-1 defined a 4 px-base token scale; Round 2 enforces
  that every layout uses only tokens, never raw pixel literals. Two
  halves: (a) **lint** — `cargo run --example mde-grid-lint`
  walks the Iced source AST and flags any `Length::Fixed(n)`,
  `padding(n)`, or `spacing(n)` where `n` is not in the token set;
  CI step in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` fails the build on
  violations. (b) **debug overlay** — `MDE_DEBUG_GRID=1` env
  toggles a translucent 8 px grid + 4 px sub-grid overlay on every
  Workbench surface for visual verification.
  Acceptance: lint clean on `main`; overlay screenshots committed
  under `docs/design/benchmarks/grid/`.
  Depends: UX-1 (Round 1). Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/examples/mde-grid-lint.rs`;
  `crates/mde-theme/src/debug_grid.rs`; CI workflow step.

- [ ] **UX-13: Exhaustive state-matrix gallery + golden capture —
  v2.2 scope (UX-25 restructure, 2026-05-21)** — For every
  interactive component shipped by `mde-theme` (button, input,
  toggle, dropdown, tab, nav-item, list-row, card, badge, tooltip,
  scrollbar) document and implement the full state matrix:
  **rest, hover, active, focus, focus-visible (keyboard-only),
  disabled, loading, error, success, empty**. Each state has a
  live render in a new gallery example built with
  `cargo run --example gallery -p mde-theme`. **UX-25
  restructure:** UX-13 now also OWNS the snapshot baseline —
  acceptance includes capturing PNG goldens into
  `tests/snapshots/{dark,light}/{compact,comfortable,spacious}/
  component-state.png` for every component × state × theme ×
  density combination (~660 goldens at full coverage per FU-2).
  UX-23 collapses to the CI workflow that re-runs the gallery
  and diffs against these goldens — single source of truth, no
  drift between gallery and golden set.
  Acceptance: gallery shows every component × every applicable
  state in dark + light + all three densities; `make
  snapshots-regen` produces the full golden tree; manual review
  confirms no "dead" state (no missing hover, no missing focus-
  visible, no missing disabled).
  Depends: UX-7 (Round 1). Effort: High.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/examples/gallery.rs`;
  `docs/design/state-matrix.md`; `tests/snapshots/` golden tree
  + `tests/snapshots/README.md` (workflow).

- [ ] **UX-14: Command palette (Ctrl-K) — v2.2 scope** — Add a
  Raycast/Linear-style command palette to Workbench. Trigger
  **Ctrl+K** (Q33, no Cmd on Linux). Surface per locks:
  **Spotlight-style** (Q34) — centered, semi-transparent, **no
  backdrop**; **responsive 640 → 800 px width** (Q35);
  480 px max-height; surface-2 fill with `SHADOW_3` elevation;
  16 px corners (Q45 modal radius); focus-trapped.
  **UX-27 dismiss sub-lock (2026-05-21):** dismiss is
  **Esc (always) + click outside the palette rect** —
  implemented via Iced 0.14's global `Subscription::on_event`
  filter checking `mouse::Event::ButtonPressed` against the
  palette bounding box (depends on UX-PRE). No invisible
  full-window event-catcher (that would negate Q34's
  "no backdrop" lock). Index at Workbench startup: (a) every
  Workbench panel route ("go to Fleet > Inventory");
  (b) every mded setting ("set display gamma"); (c) every mesh
  peer ("ssh into laptop-2"); (d) every recent / pinned
  playbook; (e) every quick-action (toggle theme, lock screen,
  sign out). Fuzzy matcher: `nucleo-matcher` crate (Helix's).
  Default view: **category tabs** — Commands / Peers / Files /
  Settings (Q36), arrow-key cycles inside the active tab,
  Tab cycles tabs. Enter activates selected row.
  Acceptance: opens in ≤ 50 ms; keystroke-to-paint latency ≤
  16 ms; 100% keyboard-navigable (no mouse required); Esc and
  outside-click both dismiss cleanly without artifact.
  Depends: UX-13, **UX-PRE** (Iced 0.14 for global mouse capture).
  Effort: High.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-workbench/src/command_palette/`;
  keybinding registration in `mde-session`.

- [✓] **UX-15: Density modes — token + persistence landed
  2026-05-21; Settings panel wiring tracked as UX-15.a** —
  `mde-theme::Density { Compact, Comfortable, Spacious }` enum
  (Q26/Q27) with `spacing_multiplier()` + stable `id()` /
  `from_id()`. `mde-theme::Preferences { theme, density, a11y }`
  aggregates the three lock surfaces with `Default`, optional
  serde Serialize/Deserialize (behind the new `serde` feature),
  `from_toml_str()` / `to_toml_string()`, and XDG-aware
  `xdg_path()` (resolves to `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mde/preferences.toml`
  or `$HOME/.config/mde/preferences.toml`). 4 new prefs unit
  tests; mde-theme suite at 59/59 with all features. **Settings >
  Appearance panel + live-switch hook** tracked as UX-15.a
  follow-up — lands when the Iced Settings surface migrates to
  mde-theme. Original scope: Add a `Density` enum
  to `mde-theme` (Compact / Comfortable [default] / Spacious).
  Every spacing token resolves through active density: Compact =
  0.75×, Comfortable = 1.0×, Spacious = 1.25× of the base 4 px
  grid. User-toggleable at Settings > Appearance. Persists to
  `~/.config/mde/preferences.toml`. Switching is live (no restart).
  Power users get information density to match Linear / Things;
  new users keep the airy Comfortable default.
  Acceptance: switching density live re-flows every panel without
  overlap or clipping; all three modes pass UX-12 grid lint.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-12. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/density.rs`; Settings >
  Appearance toggle.

- [ ] **UX-16: Onboarding / wizard hero polish — v2.2 scope** —
  The Iced wizard (`crates/mde-wizard/`) owns the first impression.
  Dedicated polish pass: (a) full-bleed background gradient per
  step using the accent token; (b) per-step line-art illustration
  (320 px square, brand 1.5 px stroke) on the left half;
  (c) refined progress indicator (connected segments, active
  segment animated, not just dots); (d) micro-animation on
  next/back transitions (220 ms ease-out slide + fade);
  (e) microcopy refinement against UX-21's voice guide — every
  step's title / body / button label reviewed.
  Acceptance: wizard demo records cleanly to a 30 s GIF for the
  README; zero placeholder copy; no jarring transitions.
  Depends: UX-10. Effort: High.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-wizard/src/`;
  `data/illustrations/wizard/*.svg`.

- [>] **UX-17: App icon + brand mark refinement — initial cut
  landed 2026-05-21; multi-resolution + logotype tracked as
  UX-17.a** — Source SVG preserved at
  `docs/design/v2.2-icon-source/map-icon.svg` (NFU-2).
  Initial recolor at `data/branding/mde-icon.svg`: charcoal
  background (`#1d1d1f` per Q3) + indigo accent squares
  (`#5b6af5` per Q2). Geometry untouched — visual lineage to
  MAP2-audio preserved per Q50. Full deliverables (multi-size
  PNG renders, logotype with Geologica wordmark, README banner
  in dark + light, installer splash) tracked as UX-17.a.
  **Locked source (Q50):** start from the existing MAP2-audio mark
  at `https://github.com/matthewmackes/map2-audio/blob/master/branding/assets/map-icon.svg`
  and clean it up for MDE. The current xfce11-unified icon is retired.
  Round 2 ships: (a) primary app icon — refined vector master at
  1024 px derived from the MAP2 mark (palette aligned to MDE indigo
  `#5b6af5` + charcoal `#1d1d1f` per Q2/Q3), rendered to
  16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 px PNG + SVG; (b) brand
  logotype combining the mark with the "Mackes Desktop Environment"
  wordmark in **Geologica** (Q11/Q12); (c) README banner image
  (1280 × 320 — single static PNG per Q49, with dark + light
  variants since v2.2 ships both themes per Q5); (d) installer /
  wizard splash. Coordinate with user on each refinement step
  before final render-out.
  Acceptance: icon meets freedesktop Icon Naming Spec; renders
  cleanly at every required size; visual lineage to MAP2-audio mark
  is preserved (the family connection is intentional, not erased);
  README banner committed in both dark + light.
  Depends: UX-10. Effort: Medium (requires user collaboration on
  refinement direction).
  Outputs: `data/icons/hicolor/{16x16,24x24,...}/apps/mde.png`;
  `data/branding/` (logotype, README banner dark + light, splash).

- [ ] **UX-18: Marketing screenshot set — v2.2 scope** — Produce
  a ship-ready hero screenshot set driven by demo mode (UX-19):
  (a) Workbench overview with the Fleet panel populated; (b)
  command palette open mid-search; (c) Settings > Displays panel;
  (d) Mesh topology drawing with a realistic peer graph;
  (e) dark **and** light variants of each. Shot at 2560 × 1440 px
  with a subtle accent-gradient frame (not raw window). Output
  committed to `docs/screenshots/v2.2-hero/`; `README.md` updated
  to embed the lead image.
  **Q47 locks:** sourced from the user's actual MDE installation
  with manually sanitized peer names / data — there is no demo mode
  (UX-19 was cut). Backdrop: subtle indigo-blur gradient frame
  (Q48). README hero asset: single static PNG, 1280 × 720 (Q49).
  Dark **and** light variants per Q5.
  Acceptance: screenshots usable verbatim on a release page; passes
  a "would this convince a prospect" review.
  Depends: UX-1 through UX-9, UX-14. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `docs/screenshots/v2.2-hero/*.png`; updated `README.md`.

- ~~**UX-19: Demo mode (`mde --demo`)**~~ — **REMOVED per Q47
  (2026-05-21).** Demo mode is not in scope for v2.2. UX-18
  marketing screenshots will be sourced from the user's actual MDE
  installation with manually sanitized peer names / data. The UX-18
  dependency on UX-19 has been dropped.

- [ ] **UX-20: Custom scrollbars + edge treatments — v2.2 scope** —
  Replace default GTK + Iced scrollbars: 4 px wide at rest, 8 px on
  hover, surface-3 track, accent thumb at 60% opacity, auto-hide
  after 800 ms idle with a smooth 200 ms fade. Add 16 px
  top/bottom edge gradients on scrollable regions so users see
  "more below / more above" cues without harsh cutoffs. A single
  visible "default scrollbar" tells a prospect this is a hobby
  project — Round 2 closes that tell.
  Acceptance: no panel still uses default scrollbar styling;
  gradients render without overlapping content; gallery (UX-13)
  shows the scrollbar in all states.
  Depends: UX-1, UX-13. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/components/scrollbar.rs`;
  matching GTK CSS for any remaining GTK surfaces.

- [✓] **UX-21: Voice + tone doc landed 2026-05-21 (audit pass
  tracked as UX-21.a)** — `docs/design/voice-and-tone.md` ships
  the rules: voice constants, tone-per-surface table, verb
  discipline (Add vs Create vs New, Remove vs Delete, etc.),
  sentence-case enforcement, button-label discipline (verb-first,
  ≤ 3 words), error-message recipe (what + what-to-do), empty-
  state spec (icon + heading + body + CTA), status-badge
  vocabulary, numbers/units conventions, and the forbidden-strings
  audit checklist. CONTRIBUTING.md path: any string-touching PR
  cites this doc. The workspace-wide sweep that audits every
  visible string against the rules is tracked as UX-21.a follow-
  up (mechanical pass, easier when the consumer-side migration
  in UX-3..UX-9 has landed). Original scope text: Author
  `docs/design/voice-and-tone.md`: verb-usage rules (Add vs
  Create vs New — pick one), sentence-case titles (not Title
  Case), error-message style (what happened + what to do —
  never both vague), empty-state copy (specific, friendly, one
  clear CTA), button labels (verb-first, ≤ 3 words). Then sweep
  every user-visible string in the Iced workspace through the
  rules. Strings are part of the UI; this is not a copy-editing
  pass, it is a product-credibility pass.
  Acceptance: every visible string reviewed and either kept or
  rewritten; voice doc cited from `CONTRIBUTING.md`; grep across
  the workspace finds zero "TODO" / "Lorem ipsum" / "test" /
  "foo" strings reachable from the UI.
  Depends: UX-10. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `docs/design/voice-and-tone.md`; updated string
  literals across all crates.

- [✓] **UX-22: Accessibility variants — token layer landed
  2026-05-21 (Settings panel wiring tracked as UX-22.a)** —
  `mde-theme::accessibility::A11y` ships the variant data model:
  `high_contrast` (boosts text to fully opaque + widens border
  alpha to 0.40/0.45 for AAA-grade legibility), `colorblind_safe`
  (swaps indigo accent for ColorBrewer-Set2 green `#4daf4a`,
  discriminates under deuteranopia / protanopia / tritanopia),
  `reduce_motion` (caps transition durations at 80 ms per Q32).
  `A11y::apply(Palette) -> Palette` composes the variants over the
  base palette without mutating the source. 9 unit tests covering
  default state, individual variants, composition, and reduce-motion
  duration capping. **Settings > Accessibility panel** wiring +
  preferences.toml persistence is a Settings-panel task (UX-22.a)
  that lands when the Iced Settings surface is touched in UX-3..9.
  Original scope: Premium means
  accessible. (a) Honor `prefers-reduced-motion` (read via the
  Wayland/X11 session bus, fall back to a preferences toggle):
  when reduced, every UX-9 transition collapses to instant or
  ≤ 80 ms cross-fade. (b) Ship a high-contrast theme variant:
  every token gains a `high_contrast()` form where text/
  background contrast ≥ 12:1 and borders become 2 px instead of
  1 px. (c) Ship a colorblind-safe accent variant: drop electric
  indigo for a ColorBrewer-derived safe trio. All three
  accessible from Settings > Accessibility.
  Acceptance: each variant passes its respective audit (motion-
  disabled walkthrough, AAA contrast spot-check via the UX-12
  contrast checker, deuteranopia simulator screenshot).
  Depends: UX-3, UX-9. Effort: Medium.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-theme/src/accessibility.rs`; Settings >
  Accessibility panel in workbench.

- [ ] **UX-23: Visual-regression CI gate — v2.2 scope (UX-26
  test-matrix scoping, 2026-05-21)** — Without enforcement,
  Round 1 + Round 2 polish will drift back to chaos inside two
  releases. UX-23 ships the gate. **UX-25 restructure:** UX-13
  owns the gallery + golden capture; UX-23 is just the CI wrapper.
  Tooling: `cargo run --example gallery` builds under the
  Wayland-in-Docker runner specified by HW-3, emits PNGs into
  `tests/snapshots/{dark,light}/{compact,comfortable,spacious}/`,
  diffs against committed goldens via `image-compare` crate.
  **UX-26 test-matrix scoping:**
  - **Coverage:** 11 components × 10 states × 2 themes × 3
    densities = up to 660 goldens; some states are not applicable
    to some components (e.g., scrollbar has no "loading" state) so
    actual count ~440.
  - **Storage:** 8-bit PNG, ≤ 8 KB per golden (gallery cells are
    small); total disk budget ~3.5 MB.
  - **Diff tolerance:** 0.5% (Lab-distance via `image-compare`),
    not pixel-exact — robust against subpixel-render variance
    across runners.
  - **Regeneration command:** `make snapshots-regen` (calls the
    same gallery + headless capture chain, overwrites goldens).
  - **Review workflow:** PRs touching
    `crates/mde-{theme,workbench,panel,files,wizard,logout-dialog}/src/`
    MUST either pass diff or land with a `design-review` PR label +
    reviewer sign-off. The CI bot posts the diff image inline on
    the PR for visual review.
  - **Failure paths:** if HW-3 (Wayland-in-Docker) isn't ready,
    UX-23 runs on the developer's laptop via `make snapshots-local`
    and attaches output as PR artifact — manual gate not CI gate
    until HW-3 lands.
  Acceptance: CI workflow green on `main`; a deliberate visual
  regression in a feature branch fails CI; updating the golden +
  applying `design-review` label re-greens.
  Depends: **UX-13** (gallery + goldens), HW-3 (CI runner —
  fall back to local gate if HW-3 deferred). Effort: Medium
  (most logic now lives in UX-13).
  Outputs: `.github/workflows/ui-snapshot.yml`;
  `Makefile` targets `snapshots-regen` / `snapshots-local`;
  `image-compare` dep added to `mde-theme/Cargo.toml`
  (dev-dependencies).

**Definition of Done for UX-10..UX-23 (group):** all subtasks
`[✓] Done` per §0.8; the operational quality-bar table above
measured and met (60 fps animations, ≥ 7:1 body contrast, 0
off-grid spacing literals, ≤ 120 ms first-paint, ≤ 50 ms
command-palette open, 0 default-GTK widgets visible); brand
identity spec (UX-10) reviewed and approved by user; benchmark
vault (UX-11) seeded; marketing screenshot set (UX-18)
committed and embedded in README; visual-regression CI gate
(UX-23) green on `main`; CHANGELOG entry under v2.2.

### UX-24..UX-28: Round 3 design-review refinements (landed 2026-05-21)

> These items came out of a same-session UX-design review. They
> are all worklist refinements to UX-1..UX-23 — no new
> implementation scope, no new effort. Recorded here for audit
> trail; each is already applied to the relevant UX-N task above.

- [✓] **UX-24: Density × pixel-lock sub-lock — landed
  2026-05-21** — Density modifier (Q26/Q27) scales spacing
  tokens only, not component dimensions. Preserves WCAG 2.5.5
  touch-target floor across all three density modes. Applied to
  design-locks section, override #10. Implementation guidance
  baked into UX-15 acceptance via the design-locks reference.

- [✓] **UX-25: UX-13 ↔ UX-23 dependency restructure — landed
  2026-05-21** — UX-13 now owns gallery + snapshot golden
  capture as part of its DoD. UX-23 collapses to "the CI
  workflow that wraps UX-13's gallery + diffs the goldens."
  Eliminates drift risk between gallery and goldens. Applied to
  UX-13 and UX-23 task descriptions.

- [✓] **UX-26: UX-23 test-matrix explicit scoping — landed
  2026-05-21** — UX-23 now specifies: ~440 goldens (component ×
  state × theme × density with not-applicable filtering); 8-bit
  PNG ≤ 8 KB each; 0.5% Lab-distance diff tolerance via
  `image-compare`; `make snapshots-regen` regeneration command;
  `design-review` PR label workflow; HW-3 fallback path for
  local-gate-instead-of-CI-gate during HW-3 deferral. Applied to
  UX-23 task description.

- [✓] **UX-27: UX-14 dismiss-interaction sub-lock — landed
  2026-05-21** — Q34's "no backdrop" left dismiss interaction
  ambiguous. Locked: Esc + outside-rect click via Iced 0.14's
  global mouse-event subscription. No invisible event catcher.
  Depends on UX-PRE. Applied to UX-14 task description.

- [✓] **UX-28: UX-10 rescope to lock-narration — landed
  2026-05-21** — UX-10's "discover the brand from scratch"
  framing is obsolete after the 50-Q + FU + NFU lock set.
  Rescoped to "narrate the existing locks into
  `docs/design/visual-identity.md`, citing Q-IDs as source."
  Effort drops to Low (consolidation). Applied to UX-10 task
  description.

### WF-1..WF-5: Workflow best-practice additions (landed 2026-05-21)

> Workflow improvements to keep the polish cadence honest and the
> design system from rotting. All landed in this session.

- [✓] **WF-1: §0.11 PR-based branch lane for UX-* work —
  landed 2026-05-21 (LOCAL-ONLY caveat)** — Visual / design work
  doesn't fit the main-only default of §0.1. Added §0.11 to
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: UX-* tasks land via `ux/<task-id>` feature
  branches; PR description includes before/after screenshots in
  dark + light; merge after explicit user OK. Code-only tasks
  retain main-only. **Caveat:** `.claude/` is gitignored
  (intentional, per current .gitignore policy: "Claude Code
  harness state — transient, not part of source"). Therefore
  §0.11 binds **this** workspace only; it does not propagate to
  other contributors or fresh clones. See WF-1.a follow-up if
  project-wide enforcement is desired.
  Outputs: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.11 (local working tree).

- [✓] **WF-1.a: CLAUDE.md persistence — landed 2026-05-21
  via option (b)** — `.gitignore` amended to carve out
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/settings.json`, and
  `.claude/hooks/*.sh` from the blanket `.claude/` ignore.
  Skills, worktrees, and `settings.local.json` remain
  gitignored (transient harness state per the original
  intent). CLAUDE.md (§0.11, §1.1), settings.json (hooks
  block), and `post-worklist-write.sh` now ship and
  propagate to fresh clones. **WF-1 / WF-4 / WF-5 LOCAL-ONLY
  caveats above are now lifted.**

- [✓] **WF-2: `make verify` aggregate target — landed
  2026-05-21** — `Makefile` gained `verify` target that runs the
  relevant §0.7 pre-commit gates conditionally based on
  `git diff --name-only`: smoke + test-nodeps + lint (Python),
  rust-check (Rust), CSS lint (CSS), `cargo run --example
  mde-grid-lint` (when UX-12 lands). One command replaces the
  five-step gate ritual. `ci.yml` calls the same target so local
  and CI behavior stay bit-identical.
  Outputs: `Makefile` `verify` target.

- [✓] **WF-3: `ui-screenshot.yml` PR-screenshot workflow —
  landed 2026-05-21** — `.github/workflows/ui-screenshot.yml`
  triggers on PRs touching `data/css/**`, `crates/mde-*/src/**`,
  or `mackes/workbench/**`. Runs `xvfb-run` against a headless
  build, captures key panels, posts them as a PR comment. Audit
  trail for every visual change; builds the muscle for UX-23
  incrementally without depending on HW-3.
  Outputs: `.github/workflows/ui-screenshot.yml`.

- [✓] **WF-4: Worklist-to-memory auto-sync hook — landed
  2026-05-21 (LOCAL-ONLY caveat — same as WF-1)** —
  `.claude/hooks/post-worklist-write.sh` watches edits to
  `docs/PROJECT_WORKLIST.md` for new headers matching
  `(?i)(locked|lock|survey|design.lock)` and emits a stderr
  reminder ("⚠ new lock detected — consider surfacing in
  memory"). Wired into `.claude/settings.json` under
  `hooks.PostToolUse` with matcher `Edit|Write`. Prevents future
  lock surveys from being manually-shipped-only.
  **Caveat:** `.claude/` gitignored → local-only; see WF-1.a.
  Outputs: `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/hooks/post-worklist-write.sh`
  (both local working tree).

- [✓] **WF-5: §1.1 release-tag schema in CLAUDE.md — landed
  2026-05-21 (LOCAL-ONLY caveat — same as WF-1)** — Added §1.1
  to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`: every worklist task title must start
  with a target-release prefix (e.g., `v2.1: UX-14 …`,
  `v2.0.1: hotfix …`, or workstream prefix like `UX-14:`,
  `CB-1.5.a:`, `WF-2:`). Active section is the live work for
  `target >= current_release`; History carries
  `target < current_release`. Pre-commit hook validation deferred
  to **WF-5.a follow-up** (script straightforward but needs
  testing on real CI before being marked Done).
  **Caveat:** `.claude/` gitignored → local-only; see WF-1.a.
  Outputs: `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §1.1 (local working tree).

- [✓] **WF-5.a: Pre-commit hook validating release-tag prefix —
  landed 2026-05-21** — `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-worklist.sh`
  scans the STAGED diff of `docs/PROJECT_WORKLIST.md` for added
  active-task lines (`+- [ ]` / `+- [>]` / `+- [!]`) and
  validates the title against
  `^([A-Z][A-Za-z0-9.-]*|v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?):` —
  catches `v2.0.1:`, `UX-14:`, `CB-1.5.a:`, `WF-5.a:`, `FU-1:`,
  `NFU-2:`, `XOrg-1.2:`, `HW-3:`, etc. Pre-existing tasks are
  NOT audited (only staged additions); Done lines (`+- [✓]`)
  are skipped. Block-on-violation with the offending titles
  listed.
  Installation: `make install-hooks` symlinks
  `.git/hooks/pre-commit` → the script. Documented in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Never touches `git config`.
  Outputs: `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-worklist.sh`,
  `Makefile` `install-hooks` target, `CONTRIBUTING.md` section.

### BR-0..BR-5: Brand asset pack + 5 branding directions (v2.2 scope)

> Locked 2026-05-21 via in-session 2-Q survey (asset dir =
> `assets/brand/` at workspace root; packaging = runtime-loaded
> with baked `include_bytes!` fallback). Direction: place an
> "extensive branding footprint" on the interface across five
> coordinated surfaces, with every piece of artwork loaded at
> runtime so it can be swapped without rebuilding. Full slot
> table + AI generation prompts at `assets/brand/README.md`.
>
> **Artwork status (2026-05-21):** ChatGPT-generated PNG art
> for 6 slots imported by BR-0.b. BR-1 / BR-3 / BR-4 / BR-5
> can now wire to real artwork instead of placeholders. The
> imported PNGs are raster (not tintable); a follow-up
> vectorization pass (BR-0.c) would upgrade them to
> `currentColor`-friendly SVGs for theme-aware tinting.
> Vectorization is optional — the PNGs ship as-is.

- [✓] **BR-0: Brand asset pack scaffold — landed 2026-05-21** —
  `assets/brand/` directory at workspace root with placeholder
  SVGs (wordmark, wordmark-hero, monogram, app-icon,
  greeter-wordmark) plus `raw/`, `cursor/`, `sounds/`
  subdirectories. `mde_theme::brand` module ships `Brand`
  loader, `BrandSlot` enum (6 slots), and `BrandSource`
  diagnostic enum. Resolution order: `$MDE_BRAND_DIR` →
  `/usr/share/mde/brand/` → baked `include_bytes!` fallback.
  6 unit tests cover baked-fallback, override-wins, missing-
  fallthrough, canonical filenames, and tintability/fill
  consistency — all green. Surface re-exported from
  `mde_theme::{Brand, BrandSlot, BrandSource}`. Replacement
  workflow + AI prompt template documented in
  `assets/brand/README.md`. Effort spent: Low.

- [✓] **BR-0.a: Multi-extension probe + LogoLockup slot —
  landed 2026-05-21** — Brand loader now probes both `.svg`
  and `.png` at every layer (SVG wins when both exist, except
  `GreeterHero` which is png-only). New `BrandFormat` enum
  + `BrandAsset` struct give consumers a typed
  (bytes, format, source) triple so they can pick
  `svg::Handle` vs `image::Handle` without re-sniffing. New
  `BrandSlot::LogoLockup` slot for the 1:1 stacked "Mackes /
  MDE" brand mark (About-panel hero, splash surfaces). New
  helpers: `BrandSlot::basename()`, `BrandSlot::search_exts()`,
  `BrandFormat::ext()`, `Brand::resolve()`. Placeholder SVGs
  moved to `assets/brand/baked/` so the runtime probe sees
  only real art and not the placeholders. 9 unit tests (added
  3: png-wins-over-baked, svg-wins-over-png-in-same-dir,
  greeter-hero-png-only). Re-exports updated:
  `mde_theme::{Brand, BrandAsset, BrandFormat, BrandSlot,
  BrandSource}`.

- [✓] **BR-0.b: Import ChatGPT-generated brand artwork —
  landed 2026-05-21** — 7 PNGs imported from
  `assets/brand/upload/` (8 source files, 2 byte-identical
  duplicates collapsed to 1 LogoLockup). Mapping:
  `wordmark.png` (2508×627), `wordmark-hero.png` (2508×627),
  `monogram.png` (1254²), `app-icon.png` (1254²),
  `greeter-hero.png` (1672×941), `greeter-wordmark.png`
  (2508×627), `logo-lockup.png` (1254²). Originals archived
  in `assets/brand/raw/` for audit / future re-vectorization.
  Placeholder SVGs preserved in `assets/brand/baked/` as the
  `include_bytes!` ultimate fallback (still picked up if the
  brand dir is somehow missing at runtime). README rewritten
  to document the new layout + provide a PNG→SVG upgrade
  recipe via potrace.

- [ ] **BR-0.c: Vectorize the imported PNGs (PNG → tintable
  SVG) — v2.2 scope** — Hand-trace each of the 5 tintable
  slots (`wordmark`, `wordmark-hero`, `monogram`,
  `greeter-wordmark`, `logo-lockup`) to SVG via potrace,
  applying the README's PNG→SVG recipe. Each resulting SVG
  uses `currentColor` for fills so the consumer can tint at
  render time (sidebar header inverts mark color between dark
  and light themes; About panel can switch tint with theme
  swap). `app-icon` and `greeter-hero` stay as PNG (fixed
  palette / photographic). Acceptance: after this lands,
  `BrandFormat::Svg` is the resolved format for every
  tintable slot in a default install. Depends: BR-0.b (done),
  potrace installed locally (`dnf install potrace`).
  Effort: Medium (~30 min per slot × 5).

- [ ] **BR-0.d: Decide brand module home (re-wire into
  mde-theme vs extract to its own crate) — v2.2 scope** —
  `crates/mde-theme/src/brand.rs` was written and tested in
  the BR-0 / BR-0.a passes (9 unit tests, all green when the
  module is declared in `lib.rs`). As of 2026-05-21 the
  `pub mod brand;` declaration and `pub use brand::{Brand,
  BrandAsset, BrandFormat, BrandSlot, BrandSource}` re-export
  have been removed from `crates/mde-theme/src/lib.rs` by an
  intentional external edit, leaving `brand.rs` orphaned on
  disk and unreachable to consumers. Pick one:
    1. **Re-wire into mde-theme** — add `pub mod brand;` +
       the re-export back to `lib.rs`. Simplest; brand
       artwork stays alongside palette/typography/spacing
       which is a clean conceptual home.
    2. **Extract to `crates/mde-brand/`** — new workspace
       member, move `brand.rs` → `crates/mde-brand/src/lib.rs`,
       update the baked `include_bytes!` paths (currently
       `../../../assets/brand/baked/*.svg`, would become
       `../../assets/brand/baked/*.svg`), add the new crate
       to the workspace `members` list. Worth it if the brand
       pack grows new code surface (asset bake pipeline,
       image processing, etc.) that doesn't belong in the
       design-token crate.
    3. **Delete `brand.rs`** — if the brand pack should live
       elsewhere entirely (e.g., loaded directly by each
       consumer crate without a shared loader), drop the
       file and `assets/brand/baked/`. Less coupling but
       duplicates the load-resolution logic in every
       consumer.
  Either option 1 or 2 unblocks BR-1..BR-5, all of which
  need `Brand::resolve()` reachable from their consumer
  crates. Option 3 forces a redesign of BR-1..BR-5.
  Depends: pick-one decision. Effort: Low (re-wire) /
  Medium (extract + workspace plumbing) / Low (delete).

- [ ] **BR-1: Branded sidebar chrome — v2.2 scope** — Permanent
  MDE wordmark at the top of the sidebar (load
  `BrandSlot::Wordmark` via `mde_theme::Brand`, render with
  `iced::widget::svg`, tint via `currentColor` to
  `palette.text_primary`, height 32 px in Comfortable density).
  IBM Plex Mono build/version footer at the sidebar bottom:
  `mde <version> · <git short> · <session type>` from
  `env!("CARGO_PKG_VERSION")`, `vergen` git hash, and
  `XDG_SESSION_TYPE`. Footer text uses `palette.text_muted` at
  `FontSize::xs`. Wires into `crates/mde-workbench/src/sidebar.rs`
  alongside the in-progress UX-5 sidebar refresh.
  Depends: BR-0 (done). Effort: Low.

- [ ] **BR-2: Indigo thread motif — v2.2 scope** — A 2 px
  `palette.accent` (#5b6af5) rule used as a connecting visual
  motif across the shell: top edge of the sidebar, underline
  beneath the active nav item, left edge of focused cards,
  divider at the top of every modal/dialog. No artwork needed
  — pure `iced::widget::container` styling on existing
  components. Goal: reads as one continuous "wire" running
  through the UI instead of scattered accent highlights.
  Touches `sidebar.rs`, `panel_chrome.rs` (in-progress),
  `mde-peer-card`, `mde-drawer`, every modal in
  `mde-workbench`.
  Depends: BR-0 (done, optional — pure styling, no asset
  load). Effort: Medium (touches many files but each touch
  is small).

- [ ] **BR-3: Branded empty states — v2.2 scope** — Every
  empty list, empty panel, and first-run pane renders the
  monogram (`BrandSlot::Monogram` at 96–192 px, tinted to
  `palette.text_muted`), a one-line tip in Geologica
  (`TypeRole::Body`), and a Plex Mono hint key (e.g.,
  `⌘K` for command palette). Wires into the existing
  `EmptyState` helper that used to live in `mde-theme::components`
  (currently absent from the crate — needs re-creation as part
  of this task; the helper signature is
  `EmptyState::new(monogram_bytes, title, hint).view()` with
  tintable monogram). Audit every panel in `mde-workbench` to
  use the helper instead of bespoke "no items yet" text.
  Depends: BR-0 (done) + monogram artwork swap (user-supplied).
  Effort: Medium.

- [ ] **BR-4: About panel brand showcase — v2.2 scope** — Full-
  bleed `BrandSlot::WordmarkHero` at the top of the About
  panel, build/peer/session info in Plex Mono (version, git
  hash, build date, current sway/X session, mesh peer count,
  active theme + density), palette swatches (color chips for
  every `Palette` field with hex codes), font specimens
  (Geologica regular/bold at hero/body/caption sizes + IBM
  Plex Mono at body/caption), credits crawl (auto-scrolling
  list from `AUTHORS`). Doubles as the design system's own
  live demo page — `mde-workbench --about` opens it directly.
  Diagnostic dump shows each `BrandSource` (Override / System
  / Baked) so the user can verify which art layer is active.
  Depends: BR-0 (done) + wordmark-hero artwork swap (user-
  supplied). Effort: Medium.

- [ ] **BR-5: Session-level brand identity — v2.2 scope** —
  Three coordinated surfaces, all swappable via
  `assets/brand/`:
  * **Branded greeter** (`mde-greeter` binary, sway-spawned
    pre-session): full-bleed `BrandSlot::GreeterHero` PNG
    background with `BrandSlot::GreeterWordmark` foreground
    centered. Falls back to flat charcoal + wordmark when
    the hero PNG is absent. Dismisses on session start.
  * **MDE cursor theme** at `assets/brand/cursor/`: indigo-
    halo cursor variants (left_ptr, hand2, watch, xterm,
    crosshair, …). Strategy: fork upstream Bibata or
    Capitaine and re-tint to indigo rather than generate
    from scratch (~30 cursor roles, hand-drawing each is a
    week of work, retinting is an afternoon). Installs to
    `/usr/share/icons/mde/` and is selected via
    `~/.icons/default/index.theme`.
  * **Audio identity** at `assets/brand/sounds/`:
    `login-chord.ogg` (~1.2 s stereo, plays once when
    greeter dismisses) + `notification.ogg` (~200 ms mono,
    plays on every notification surface from
    `mde-notification-center`). 48 kHz Ogg Vorbis. Audio
    pipeline: `mded` spawns `paplay` via std::process.
  Depends: BR-0 (done) + greeter-hero PNG + cursor theme
  + audio files (user-supplied). Effort: High (greeter
  binary + cursor theme work + audio asset production).

**Definition of Done for BR-0..BR-5 (group):** All five
surfaces ship in `main`; the user can drop a replacement
SVG / PNG into `assets/brand/` (or set `$MDE_BRAND_DIR`)
and see it picked up on next render without recompile; the
About panel (BR-4) shows the live brand source for every
slot so swap verification is one-glance; visual regression
goldens (UX-23) include the placeholder + a hand-supplied
"reference brand pack" capture so future art swaps don't
silently break layouts.

### Iteration-loop follow-ups (added 2026-05-21)

These items emerged from the iteration loop's pragmatic landing of
UX-1..UX-12 + UX-21/22 token-layer + skeletons. Each closes the
"data layer / structure" gate of its parent task; the open follow-
ups close the "consumer-side wiring" or "content fill-in" gate.

- [ ] **UX-17.a: App icon multi-resolution renders + logotype +
  README banner — v2.2 scope** — Render `data/branding/mde-icon.svg`
  to PNGs at 16 / 24 / 32 / 48 / 64 / 128 / 256 / 512 px, install
  to `data/icons/hicolor/<size>/apps/mde.png` per freedesktop spec.
  Compose the logotype (icon + "Mackes Desktop Environment" in
  Geologica per Q11/Q12). Compose README banners (1280 × 320 dark
  + light per Q5 / Q49). Wire installer splash. Depends: UX-17
  initial cut (done). Effort: Medium (needs ImageMagick / Inkscape
  +  design eye + user coordination). Outputs:
  `data/icons/hicolor/{16x16,24x24,...}/apps/mde.png`;
  `data/branding/mde-logotype.svg`;
  `data/branding/readme-banner-{dark,light}.png`.

- [ ] **UX-11.a: Benchmark vault content fill-in — v2.2 scope** —
  Capture and annotate ≥ 12 screenshots across the six target
  apps (linear / raycast / arc / cursor / vercel / apple-settings).
  Each subfolder gets `<target>-<surface>-<state>.png` PNGs at
  1280 × auto-height plus "What to adopt / What to NOT adopt"
  notes in the per-target README. Closes UX-11's content gate.
  Depends: UX-11 skeleton (done). Effort: Medium (capture +
  annotation; possibly user-driven for legal/screenshot-rights
  reasons). Outputs: `docs/design/benchmarks/<target>/*.png` +
  README annotations.

- [ ] **UX-21.a: Workspace voice-and-tone audit sweep — v2.2 scope** —
  Mechanical sweep through every user-visible string in
  `crates/mde-*/src/`, `mackes/workbench/`, `mackes/wizard/`,
  `docs/help/*.md`, `data/applications/*.desktop`, and
  CHANGELOG.md against the rules in `docs/design/voice-and-tone.md`.
  Forbidden-strings grep + verb-discipline + sentence-case + button-
  label length checks. Most efficient after UX-3..UX-9 land their
  Iced view migrations (less churn). Depends: UX-21 doc (done),
  UX-3..9 (open). Effort: Medium. Outputs: workspace-wide string
  updates; possibly a `tools/voice-audit.sh` helper.

- [ ] **UX-15.a: Settings > Appearance panel wiring + live density
  switch — v2.2 scope** — Surface the Theme + Density toggles in
  the Iced Settings > Appearance panel. Persist via `Preferences::
  to_toml_string()` + write to `Preferences::xdg_path()`. Live
  re-render on toggle (no restart). Read at startup via
  `Preferences::from_toml_str()` falling back to `Default::default()`.
  Depends: UX-15 data layer (done), Settings panel migration to
  mde-theme (part of UX-3..9). Effort: Low.
  Outputs: `crates/mde-workbench/src/settings/appearance.rs`;
  preferences.toml schema entries.

- [ ] **UX-22.a: Settings > Accessibility panel wiring — v2.2 scope** —
  Surface the A11y variants from `mde-theme::accessibility` in the
  Settings > Accessibility Iced panel. Persist `high_contrast`,
  `colorblind_safe`, `reduce_motion` to `~/.config/mde/preferences.toml`.
  Live re-render on toggle (no restart). Honor
  `prefers-reduced-motion` from the session bus as the initial
  value of `reduce_motion`. Depends: UX-22 data layer (done),
  Settings panel migration to mde-theme (part of UX-3..9).
  Effort: Medium. Outputs: `crates/mde-workbench/src/settings/
  accessibility.rs`; preferences.toml schema entry.



1. **Brand is now written, not vibes.** UX-10 commits the visual
   identity to a doc that downstream tasks must cite.
2. **"Premium" is operationalized.** Replaces Round 1's "looks
   credible" with a measurable acceptance table (fps, contrast,
   grid, latency).
3. **Benchmarks are named and stored.** UX-11 turns "elite team"
   into Linear / Raycast / Arc / Cursor / Vercel / Apple System
   Settings, with annotated reference shots.
4. **State matrix is exhaustive and gallery-validated.** UX-13
   moves beyond Round 1's "consistent states" to a buildable
   gallery covering 11 components × 10 states.
5. **Ships the single highest-impact "feels premium" feature.**
   Command palette (UX-14) — every serious productivity tool has
   one; Round 1 omitted it.
6. **Demo mode (UX-19) makes screenshots and live demos
   reproducible.** Marketing assets stop being a one-off
   handcraft.
7. **Density modes (UX-15) give power users a real lever**,
   matching Linear / Notion / Things.
8. **Accessibility is a feature deliverable (UX-22), not an
   afterthought.** Reduced motion, high contrast, and
   colorblind-safe ship as user-selectable variants.
9. **Visual-regression CI gate (UX-23) prevents polish from
   rotting.** Round 1 alone would drift in two releases without
   this.
10. **Wizard is its own workstream (UX-16),** since the first
    boot owns the first impression and deserves dedicated
    attention rather than inheriting generic panel polish.

Last updated: 2026-05-21 - Claude Opus 4.7 (Round 2 — iterated
on Round 1's UX-1..UX-9 with measurable acceptance, named
benchmarks, command palette, demo mode, and CI-enforced
regression prevention)

## History — shipped 1.0.6 through 1.1.0

(unchanged from the prior consolidation — see git for the full
release notes)

### 1.0.6 (2026-05-18) — first-boot panel polish

Phase 8.5.1–8.5.5 in full. Carbon icon recolor at load, dock
auto-sizing, 12-hour clock + weather popover, status-cluster
review popovers, `_NET_WM_STRUT_PARTIAL` on both surfaces. Phase
10.1 + 10.3–10.5 (RPM rename, brand surfacing, CHANGELOG, cut
release).

### 1.0.7 (2026-05-19) — plank dock + i3 switch + status cluster

Phase 8.6.1–8.6.10 in full (Plank-parity dock with pinned
launchers + tasklist, i3 WM switcher, About Mackes window, drawer
live-data wiring pass, drawer hold/release fix, non-blocking
sidebar status refresh, `python3 -P` wrapper, strut
height-tracking poll, status cluster icon+numeric live
indicators). Phase 8.7.1–8.7.6 (top-bar window buttons —
subsequently retired in 1.1.0). Phase 8.8.1–8.8.8 (xfwm4 fully
replaced by i3; mackes-maximizer retired; `mackes-wm`
status+reset; `apply_enforce_i3` birthright step). Phase 11.1
(AppStream metainfo), 11.2 partial (status-cluster a11y), 11.3
(Wayland-readiness audit), 11.4 (keyboard-shortcuts catalog),
11.6 partial (README pass), 11.7 (pytest smoke baseline), 11.8
(GSettings decision: not shipping), 11.9 (`async_probe` +
9 conversions). Phase 12.1.1 + 12.2.1 (mackesd scaffold + SQLite
schema). Phase 10.6.1–10.6.5 + 10.6.7 (panel-swap + workspaces +
panel archive). Phases 3.1–3.5, 4.2, 5.1, 5.3–5.6, 6.3, 7.1–7.3
(all shipped in prior tags — flipped here).

### 1.0.8 (2026-05-19) — first-boot hotfix

`mackes-enforce-session` autostart converges every login onto i3
+ mackes-panel (no xfwm4, no xfce4-panel, no xfdesktop).
WorkbenchWindow WM_CLASS pinned to `Mackes-shell` + i3 float
rule. Status-cluster click target locked to `mackes --focus
<slug>` (supersedes v3.0.0 Q28).

### 1.1.0 (2026-05-19) — Win10 layout

Top bar + Plank dock retired in favor of a single 40 px bottom
taskbar (supersedes v3.0.0 §4). Layout: Start
(`apple_menu_button`) + pinned apps · focused-app hero (i3-IPC
subscribe + 280 ms GTK revealer slide) · centered i3 cluster
(SPLIT / LAYOUT / WINDOW chips, no workspace switcher) ·
NetworkManager tray icon · status cluster · two-line clock.
Right-click Start drops a 9-item Fedora admin menu via terminator
(Root Terminal / DNF / journalctl / systemctl / SELinux /
firewall / disk-clean). Left-click Start opens a new Rust
popover (`start_menu.rs`) mirroring the drawer's Quick Actions +
Toggles + Volume + 7-step Brightness sections (supersedes v3.0.0
§5). `window_buttons.rs` retired (i3 keybinds + CSD
carry it). Win10-style watermark in the lower-right showing
version + build hash + Fedora release + hostname when DNF has
updates pending (4 h poll). Carbon-themed logout dialog replaces
the xfce4-session-logout window. Carbon icon mapper popover on
every dock app right-click, writing XDG-spec user overrides to
`~/.local/share/applications/`. Clipboard manager popover on the
clipboard tray icon, backed by the mesh-replicated
`~/.cache/mackes/clipboard.json`. `mackes-clipboard-daemon`
auto-enables via a new systemd user-preset (`90-mackes.preset`).
XDG user-dirs remapped via `apply_user_dirs` birthright step to
`~/QNM-Mesh/` for the shared media folders and `~/Downloads`
local. XFCE menu hides expanded from 18 entries to 32,
propagated to existing users on every login via
`mackes-enforce-session`. `mackes update` CLI subcommand +
`.repo` file tuned to Fedora best practice. 5 i3 gaps profiles
via `mackes/i3_gaps.py` + Workbench picker. New CI gate
`tests/test_panel_xvfb_smoke.py` under Xvfb. Phase 8.7.x retired
in favor of i3-native chrome.

### XOrg-Only Fork (in progress — activated 2026-05-20)

> **Scope:** Fork the v2.0.0 MDE stack to target i3 + XOrg instead of sway +
> Wayland. The Iced/wgpu rendering layer is compositor-agnostic; the work is
> mainly a compositor-substitution pass (sway → i3, swaylock → i3lock,
> swaymsg → i3-msg) plus Cargo feature-gating and session plumbing.

- [✓] **XOrg-1.1: Add `wayland`/`x11` Cargo feature pair to workspace**
  — Introduce a `display-server` feature group. `wayland` stays the default
  (CI unchanged). `x11` gates all XOrg-specific code paths. Add to
  `mde-session`, `mackesd`, `mde-workbench`, `mde-files`,
  `mde-logout-dialog`. No logic changes in this step — just the feature
  scaffolding.0.0 Wayland ship.

- [✓] **XOrg-1.2: `mde-session` i3 back-end**
  — Under `x11` feature: `compositor_cmd()` defaults to `"i3"` (env override
  `$MDE_COMPOSITOR` already exists). `Lock` action: `swaylock` → `i3lock -c
  000000` (or `$MDE_LOCKER`). `SaveLayout`: serialize i3 IPC tree via
  `i3-msg -t get_tree` instead of sway tree format. `Logout`/`Restart`/
  `Shutdown` unchanged (same `loginctl` path). Depends on XOrg-1.1.
  **Blocked:** on hold.

- [✓] **XOrg-1.3: `mackesd` display applier — xrandr back-end**
  — `mackesd/src/settings/display.rs` calls `swaymsg output …` to
  reconfigure monitors. Under `x11`: replace with `xrandr` shell-out (same
  pattern as existing `i3-msg` calls in `mackes-panel`). Settings sidecar
  format (`~/.cache/mde/display.json`) is unchanged — applier only.
  `keybinds.rs` already writes both sway and i3 files; no change needed
  there. Depends on XOrg-1.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-1.4: `mackesd` session IPC — swaylock references**
  — `mackesd/src/ipc/session.rs` references swaylock in `Lock` and
  `SaveLayout`. Under `x11`: gate those call sites behind
  `#[cfg(feature = "x11")]` and substitute `i3lock` / i3 IPC tree read.
  Depends on XOrg-1.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-2.1: Iced X11 rendering — add `x11` winit feature**
  — Add `"x11"` to the Iced features list in `mde-workbench/Cargo.toml`,
  `mde-files/Cargo.toml`, and `mde-logout-dialog/Cargo.toml` under the `x11`
  Cargo feature gate. Iced 0.13's wgpu backend uses winit which has `x11` as
  a first-class feature; no rendering code changes needed. `DISPLAY` being
  set is sufficient for runtime. Depends on XOrg-1.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-3.1: `mde-files` — feature-gate `smithay-client-toolkit`**
  — `smithay-client-toolkit` is the only strictly-Wayland dep in the
  workspace. Under `x11` feature: gate the dep behind `wayland` in
  `mde-files/Cargo.toml`. All portal/thumbnail call sites that use it get a
  `#[cfg(feature = "x11")]` stub falling back to plain `std::fs` reads.
  No user-visible feature loss on XOrg (portals are a Flatpak/Wayland
  concept). Depends on XOrg-1.1 + XOrg-2.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-4.1: XDG session file — `mde-xorg.desktop`**
  — Add `data/xorg/mde-xorg.desktop` for display managers (GDM, LightDM).
  Type=XSession. Exec=`mde-xorg-session`. Add `data/xorg/mde-xorg-session`
  shell script: brings up `mde-session` with `MDE_COMPOSITOR=i3` + exports
  `DISPLAY`. Depends on XOrg-1.2.

- [✓] **XOrg-4.2: systemd user target — `mde-xorg.target`**
  — Add `data/systemd/user/mde-xorg.target` mirroring `mde.target` but
  binding to `DISPLAY` instead of `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`. Autostart entries that
  reference `mde.target` get an `x11`-gated copy referencing `mde-xorg.target`.
  Depends on XOrg-4.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-4.3: i3 config supplement — `data/i3/` baseline**
  — Audit `data/sway/` configs and produce i3-format equivalents in
  `data/i3/`. Keybinds already write to `~/.config/i3/config.d/` (no change).
  Focus on: bar config (i3bar or polybar), startup exec rules, and any
  sway-specific directives (output, input) that need i3 counterparts.
  Depends on XOrg-1.2.

- [✓] **XOrg-5.1: `mde-xorg` RPM sub-package**
  — Add `mde-xorg` sub-package to `packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec`.
  `Requires: i3 i3lock libxrandr`. `Conflicts: mde` (Wayland edition).
  Installs `mde-xorg.desktop` → `/usr/share/xsessions/`. Cargo build flag
  for this package: `--features x11` (replaces default `--features wayland`).
  Depends on XOrg-4.1.

- [✓] **XOrg-5.2: CI matrix — add `x11` feature build**
  — Extend `.github/workflows/` to build and test the `x11` feature set
  (`cargo build --features x11 --workspace`). Does not need a full graphical
  smoke test — compile + unit tests are sufficient to gate the fork.
  Depends on XOrg-1.1 through XOrg-3.1.

## How to add a task

Add new entries under **Active** with this shape:

```markdown
- [ ] **<release-tag>: short title** — one or two sentences of
  acceptance criteria + dependencies + estimated effort. Link to a
  design doc if the lock context is non-trivial.
```

Move to `[>] In Progress` when you start substantive work,
`[✓] Done` once Definition of Done (`.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.8) is
satisfied, `[!] Blocked` with a one-line reason if external state
stalls it. **Don't use `[~] Deferred`** — per current directive,
items are either Active, Done, or Blocked. When a newer directive
contradicts an earlier design-doc lock, the newer one wins silently
— update the affected worklist items in place; don't track the
contradiction separately.

When a task is `[✓] Done`, leave it in **Active** until the release
that contains it ships, then move it to the **History** section
with a one-line summary under the matching release tag.

## Epic: Hardware Testing

**Directive 2026-05-20 (user-locked):** items below are NOT blockers
on the active development picture — they're a self-contained epic
that runs end-to-end on bench hardware (clean Fedora installs,
QEMU VMs, sway-in-CI runners) once a release candidate is ready
for soak testing. They live here so the upstream sections stay
filterable to "code changes that can move forward today." The
status marker is `[ ] Open` (a normal todo on the epic's own
timeline), not `[!] Blocked` (which would imply something is
stalled — nothing here is stalled; the epic just runs on a
different cadence than the source tree).

### Bench-install validation (clean Fedora targets)

- [ ] **HW-1 Fresh-install bench test (was I.4 / CB-7.1)** —
  boot the `mde-2.0.0` ISO on a clean Fedora 44 box (bare-metal
  or VM), run through the wizard, assert: sway is the active
  session, mde-panel is on the layer-shell surface, mde-workbench
  opens at all 9 groups, mde-files opens with mesh-first sidebar,
  no xfce4-* RPMs installed.
- [ ] **HW-2 Upgrade bench test (was I.5 / CB-7.2)** — boot a
  pre-built `mackes-xfce-workstation-1.1.0` install (bare-metal or
  VM image), run `dnf upgrade -y`, reboot, log in, assert same
  gates as HW-1 PLUS: `mde-migrate-from-1x` ran, `~/.config/mde/`
  populated from `~/.config/mackes-shell/`,
  `~/.config/xfce4.v1x-backup.<ts>/` exists, every 1.x panel
  setting carried across (theme name, font name, power preferences,
  autostart list).

### CI-rig validation (sway / Docker in a runner)

- [ ] **HW-3 Wayland smoke (was I.3 / CB-7.3)** — headless
  sway (`WLR_BACKENDS=headless`) in a runner, launches
  mde-session, asserts `swaymsg -t get_outputs` returns the
  expected fake output, asserts mde-panel registers a toplevel
  in the foreign-toplevel listener, asserts mde-workbench opens
  on Ctrl+1. Lives in `crates/mde-workbench/tests/wayland_smoke
  .rs` + matches the existing E.29 pattern.
- [ ] **HW-4 Docker peer fan-out (was I.2)** — extends the
  Phase 12.11.2 testcontainers harness with a 4th peer pushing a
  setting revision; runs in a CI job that has a live Docker
  daemon attached.

**How to retire:** each row closes the moment the corresponding
bench / CI capability is in place and the named smoke passes on
that capability. Items in this epic are never "blocking" anything
in the upstream sections — they're a parallel sign-off pass that
runs against an already-feature-complete build.
