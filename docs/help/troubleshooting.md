# Troubleshooting

Common issues and where to look.

## Logs

Three log sources:

- **MDE actions**: `~/.local/share/mde/logs/mde.log` — every
  settings write, snapshot, preset apply, and mesh event MDE
  performed. Plain text, tail-friendly.
- **mde-session journal**: `journalctl --user -u mde-session
  .service` for session-level issues (sway didn't start, the
  first-boot migrator hit an error, the Iced panel autostart
  failed).
- **mded journal**: `journalctl -u mded.service` for the
  unified meta-daemon (worker restarts, supervisor decisions,
  D-Bus surface errors).

Headless: `journalctl -u mded.service` covers everything; there's
no separate "node" daemon on the v2.0.0 line.

## "Nothing happens when I click Apply"

MDE does immediate-apply on every widget change — there's no batch
"Apply" button. If a switch toggle doesn't seem to take effect,
check `mde.log` for a `bridge.set_setting failed:` entry — the
likely cause is the matching Rust applier in `mded` rejected the
value (look in `journalctl -u mded.service`).

## "Drift card appears even though I didn't change anything"

Probably an external tool wrote to the same sidecar / gsettings
key MDE owns. On the v2.0.0 line:

- Direct `gsettings set` calls outside MDE.
- A second app holding a write-handle on the same JSON sidecar
  under `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mde/`.
- `mded` rejected the write after staging (check
  `journalctl -u mded.service`).

Reset via Maintain → Reset to Preset.

## "Wizard doesn't find the mesh on my LAN"

mDNS issues:
- Avahi running? `systemctl status avahi-daemon`
- Multicast blocked by router? Some enterprise/hotel networks filter
  `224.0.0.251`.
- Fallback: ask the lighthouse operator for a fresh join token
  (Workbench → Network → Mesh → + Add Peer).

## "Cross-network peer can't join"

1. Confirm the lighthouse is reachable on UDP/4242 from the peer's
   network. Test with `nc -uz <lighthouse_ip> 4242`.
2. The join token bearer expires after one use — the lighthouse
   operator can generate a fresh one from the Workbench or with
   `mackesd ca sign`.
3. If UDP/4242 is blocked, Nebula falls back to TCP/443 on the
   lighthouse automatically. Check `mackesd nebula status` on the
   new peer for `active_transport: nebula_https443`.

## "Mesh peer cert expired"

```bash
# On the peer:
mackesd nebula status   # shows cert_expiry

# On the lighthouse (CA host):
mackesd ca rotate       # re-issues all peer certs
```

Peers that were offline when the CA rotation ran won't receive their
new cert until they come online. Once online, `nebula_supervisor`
picks up the updated bundle from the MDE-Workgroup coordination root
(`~/.mde-mesh/<peer>/mackesd/` on v5+ installs; legacy `~/QNM-Shared/<peer>/mackesd/`
on pre-v5 installs) within one heartbeat cycle (≤ 10 seconds).

## "Mesh peer says offline but I can ping it"

Nebula goes through the overlay cert chain. Possible causes:
- `nebula.service` crashed: `systemctl status nebula.service` on the
  peer; restart if needed.
- Peer cert expired or revoked: `mackesd ca list` on the lighthouse.
- Lighthouse unreachable: check `mackesd nebula status` on the peer;
  if `active_transport` is empty, the peer hasn't connected to any
  lighthouse yet.

## "Clipboard items aren't syncing"

- Check qnmd's `mesh-sync` module: `mackes status` should show it as
  running.
- NATS server health: `mackes maintain health` includes NATS reachability
  checks.
- 100-item cap means very-old items roll off — that's expected.

## "Thunar shows mesh:/// but it's empty"

- `gvfsd-mesh` is the GVFS backend. Check it's installed:
  `which gvfsd-mesh` should return `/usr/libexec/gvfsd-mesh`.
- qnmd not running → no mesh state to render.
- mDNS issues hiding peers — see Mesh VPN troubleshooting above.

## "ssh peer.mesh: Permission denied"

- Layer A keys may not have synced yet. Wait 30s for NATS propagation.
- Check `~/.ssh/authorized_keys` for the `# managed-by-mackes-mesh-<peer>`
  marker. If absent, Mackes hasn't received the key yet — check qnmd
  logs.
- Wrong username? Default is the wizard-running user; Mackes → Network
  → Mesh SSH → Key Distribution lets you override per peer.

## "MDE won't start"

Recovery mode (works on the 2.0.0+ binary `mde`; the 1.x binary
`mackes` is still installed for one release as a transitional alias):
```bash
$ mde recover --list      # list snapshots
$ mde recover --latest    # restore most recent snapshot
```

Or boot the recovery target via GRUB:
```
mde-recovery.target
```
Drops you to a console with snapshot restore tools.

## "I want to start over"

```bash
$ mde uninstall            # GUI or CLI
```

Removes everything MDE installed, restores default gsettings,
deletes user state under `~/.config/mde/` + `~/.cache/mde/` +
`~/.local/share/mde/`, optionally removes the `mde` package. A
final tarball snapshot lands on `~/Desktop/` as the only artifact
that survives.

## Where MDE writes on your machine

System paths Mackes installs to:
```

/usr/lib/python3.X/site-packages/mackes/
/usr/share/mackes-shell/             data tree (presets, css, branding, help)
