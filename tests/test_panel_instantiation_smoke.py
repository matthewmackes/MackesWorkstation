"""Smoke test: every WorkbenchPanel subclass can be instantiated headless.

Skipped when GTK or `$DISPLAY` (or Xvfb fallback) is unavailable. The
test walks `mackes.workbench.**`, finds every `Gtk.Box` subclass whose
name ends in `Panel`, constructs one of each, and asserts no exception
escapes the constructor.

This is the Phase 11.7 baseline. It catches:

  - import-time crashes (a panel that references a deleted helper)
  - `__init__`-time crashes (a panel that runs a blocking probe
    before the GTK main loop is running)
  - missing fixtures (CSS class names referenced before they're loaded)
  - constructor calls that need an `xfconf_bridge` argument we don't
    pass (covers refactor breakage)

It does NOT exercise:

  - the GTK main loop (no `Gtk.main()`)
  - signal handlers (nothing clicks anything)
  - the sidebar shell (handled by `test_imports.py`)

Each panel gets at most 100 ms of wall time. A panel that exceeds that
fails the test — surfaces the "blocking call on the main thread"
class of bug (Phase 11.9 reliability sweep).
