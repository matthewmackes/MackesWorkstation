# Contributing to Mackes Shell

Thanks for thinking about contributing. Mackes Shell is a small,
focused project — one GTK3 Python control panel that replaces
`xfce4-settings` on Fedora — and we keep the contribution flow simple.

## Development setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:matthewmackes/MAP2-RELEASES.git
cd MAP2-RELEASES
# System deps
sudo dnf install python3-gobject gtk3 xfconf python3-pyyaml \
    ansible-core podman tomcat
# (optional) editable install
pip install -e . --user
# Smoke test
python3 -c "import mackes; print(mackes.__version__)"
# Run the wizard
python3 -m mackes --wizard
# Run the headless TUI (without an X session)
python3 -m mackes --tui
```

## Building the RPM locally

```bash
make rpm
ls rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/
```

## Installing the git hooks

Two hooks ship with the repo under `.claude/hooks/`:

- `post-worklist-write.sh` — Claude Code PostToolUse hook
  (auto-wired via `.claude/settings.json`; no install step needed).
- `pre-commit-worklist.sh` — validates `docs/PROJECT_WORKLIST.md`
  task titles carry a release/workstream prefix per
  `.claude/CLAUDE.md §1.1`. Install with:

```bash
make install-hooks
```

This symlinks `.git/hooks/pre-commit` → `.claude/hooks/pre-commit-worklist.sh`.
Re-run after a fresh clone. No effect on `git config`.

## Project conventions

- **Python style:** `from __future__ import annotations` at the top of
  every module. Standard library first, third-party second,
  `mackes.*` third.
- **GTK panels:** all new panels follow the Carbon refresh layout —
  breadcrumb + page title + section helpers. See
  `mackes/workbench/network/mesh_ssh.py` for the canonical example.
- **Privileged ops:** route through `mackes.admin_session.AdminSession`,
  not raw `pkexec` or `sudo`.
- **CSS:** tokens (palette / type ramp) live in `data/css/tokens.css`.
  Layout classes are in `data/css/carbon-layout.css`. Per-preset
  accents are in `data/css/accents/*.css`.
- **Spacing:** strict 8px grid (4px allowed for tight controls).
- **Commits:** one logical change per commit, focused on **why** in the
  message. See `.claude/CLAUDE.md §0` for the full rulebook.
- **No `--amend` of pushed commits.** Roll forward with a new commit
  instead.

## Release flow

Maintainers ship via tag-push: bump version in four places
(`mackes/__init__.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `setup.py`,
`packaging/fedora/mackes-shell.spec`), add a CHANGELOG entry, push,
tag `vX.Y.Z`, push the tag. The release workflow at
`.github/workflows/release.yml` builds the RPM and publishes the
GitHub Release.
