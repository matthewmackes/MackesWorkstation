# install-helpers/lint-dbus-shape.sh — pre-commit gate #8
# (added 2026-05-25 per Q12 + Q20 + Q96 + EPIC-PROC-LINT of the
# 100-Q tightening survey).
#
# Catches NET-NEW D-Bus method declarations on MDE-internal
# services. Per Q20 + Q96 the canonical IPC for MDE-internal
# control + events is **Bus** (action/<domain>/<verb> for
# commands, reply/<ulid> for responses, domain topics for
# events); D-Bus retires entirely by 1.0 except for FDO
# interop (org.freedesktop.* surfaces).
#
# This gate flags any net-new `#[interface]` block (zbus
# interface declaration) in `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/` or
# any new `dbus_macros::dbus_interface` macro, EXCEPT inside
# the FDO-interop allow-list.
#
# Allow-list:
# - `crates/mded/src/fdo_*.rs` — `org.freedesktop.Notifications`
#   bridge per BUS-4.4 (and any future FDO interop surfaces)
# - `crates/mde-kdc*/src/dbus*.rs` — KDC2 KDE Connect uses D-Bus
#   for the per-app dispatch layer; that's a vendor protocol,
#   not MDE-internal
# - Existing services in `crates/mackesd/src/ipc/{nebula,portal,
#   notifications,shell}*.rs` — pre-existing surface awaiting
#   EPIC-RETIRE-DBUS migration; new methods on those are TOLERATED
#   until migration ships
#
# Per `.claude/CLAUDE.md` §0.7 gate #8.
#
# Exits 0 = clean, exits 1 = net-new MDE-internal D-Bus surface.
