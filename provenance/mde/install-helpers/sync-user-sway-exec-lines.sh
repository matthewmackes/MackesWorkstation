# sync-user-sway-exec-lines.sh — v4.0.1 BUG-11 systemic fix.
#
# Some users' ~/.config/sway/config was copied at v1.x by the birthright
# wizard and never refreshed when later MDE versions added new
# `exec mde-*` lines to data/sway/config. The most common symptom:
# the Win10 watermark + toast popovers never spawn (their `exec
# mde-popover {watermark,toast}` lines exist in the shipped config but
# not in the user's home copy).
#
# This script idempotently appends every required `exec mde-popover *`
# line that's MISSING from ~/.config/sway/config. It NEVER:
#   - reorders existing lines,
#   - removes user customizations,
#   - copies the whole system config over the user's,
#   - touches anything beyond the named exec lines.
#
# Each line we own is fingerprinted by an exact-match `grep -Fq` against
# the user's file. If the line is already present (with any leading
# whitespace), it's left alone.
#
# Invoked from mde-session.service ExecStartPost on every login.

# If the user's config doesn't exist yet (fresh login on a brand-new
# account) the birthright wizard hasn't fired — bail out, the wizard
# will write the right file.

# Required exec / bindsym lines, in the order they should appear if
# appended. Adding a new entry here makes it stick on the next login
# of every existing operator without forcing them through the wizard
# again.
#
# v4.0.1 (2026-05-23): watermark stays here even though the visible
# widget retired — `mde-popover watermark` is now the headless dnf-
# poll daemon that maintains ~/.cache/mde/dnf-updates.count for the
# start-menu footer chip.
# v4.0.1 BUG-15: Super+Shift+M binding lets the operator recover
# minimized windows from sway's scratchpad — the panel's centered
# minimize button (BUG-6) has no native sway equivalent so the
# `move scratchpad` + `scratchpad show` pair is the closest UX.
# v4.0.1 BUG-17 (2026-05-23): `exec mde-popover toast` was removed
# from REQUIRED_LINES while the empty-stack grey-box bug was open.
# Restored 2026-05-23 after the fix landed (Theme::custom with
# transparent palette background — `toasts.rs::theme()`). The
# surface still bounds itself to 360×200 (BUG-16-era fix) but
# now paints fully transparent when the stack is empty, so the
# autostart is safe.
